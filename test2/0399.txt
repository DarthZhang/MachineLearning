' i just quit :-) but the meditation's not a bad idea , either :-) you know what you want and deserve . you shall find it . he could also have strong feelings for you , but yet not be willing to go balls-to-the-wall for you , like dusty is saying ( because he's too scared , or whatever else ) . this is like the best enfp trap ... if you're lucky , when they figure it out , they'll be dying to share the laugh with you . someone should sticky this for future reference . :-) we will figure it out eventually ... and laugh really really hard .  ... once the searing pain subsides . don't hold your breath . :-) love , this basically sums up how we enfps roll , inside and out ... if anyone's taking notes . : ) though i will add that we'll be patient in person too if we see that it's mission-critical . it's very ... :-) yes ! ! ! : ) you all definitely get a nerd trophy in my eyes . : ) ^ ^ you guys are having a who's nerdier contest , aren't you ? : ) a lot of these posts explain what happens when you lack fi . how would you directly describe fi and what it does for you ? how it balances you ? thanks :) : ( you have a beautiful inner bad-ass , i'm pretty sure . sometimes we nfs do that stuff . but we might bounce back for you pretty quick . we know it sucks , we just get stuck sometimes . you are doing everything right by putting your foot down for ... it's cute when you try to articulate feelings with facts . : ) aw , jeepers . : ) this one will stay with me . thank you . i know , you guys don't believe in anything until you see it . and i know what you've seen so far is knockout punches and hot messes . just stay classy and if you feel like it , remember that it's ... i don't even hardly have that and work is boring for me too : ) it will be beautiful . and the right pick will know just what it deserves . lol ! just take care to make a good pick . : ) it might sting , not gonna lie . but if you're doing it right you'll get doctored up and snuggled afterwards . sounds like a plan . : ) the eventual punch will hurt us more than it hurts you . : ) you can have both , you know ! it's not like your logic would ever go away . doesn't have to be either / or . just sayin ' . : ) don't say we didn't warn you . ; ) love , emotions : ) [ 10char ] yeah she wasn't really doing her due diligence to unpack her feelings too well . but your calling her out helped her do that , get back on track . props . as a group i generally believe istps to be ... well , it's both the pain of the truth , and the pain of feeling like someone we love doesn't understand or appreciate us . feelings are real for us , and when someone we love doesn't see them or ... dear istp , we just love making you smile against your will . we can't help ourselves . thanks for making our day . love , exfx dear istp , we do this when we are stuck in our own emotional stuff . we need someone to acknowledge it so we can move on . sometimes you guys are not up for that job . sometimes we don't take a ... dear logic , you can't explain everything . you are not a robot . you are a human being with feelings . we are part of your reality . you can ignore us for as long as you want . we will be ... you have a lot of love in you . you just don't always pay attention to that part . but it's still right there . dear suspected enfp , it's how we love people . dear istps , it's really sad to me when you guys don't notice your own impact , or don't notice or understand how people appreciate you , or when other people don't notice you . but some do . ... it sucks to stare that terror in the eye , but once you do , you face what you want , and then you can evaluate whether that particular specimen is liable to cough it up ! i think it terrifies him ... and they are often really good at faking it ! but in my experience they like being called out on it . if they don't like being called out on it , then you are barking up the wrong tree . i think ... you guys crack me up : ) aw thanks . a happy one , with lots of dancing and / or party games , where everyone can enjoy themselves and feel included and safe , with a good sense of humor and a minimum of blood and vomit . : ) snap ! for that i may have to disappear for a couple of weeks ! ! yes ! not a fan . you boys have fun but treat yourselves with the respect you deserve . i am pretty sure those 2 are not mutually exclusive . : ) oh thanks ! ... except ( historically anyway ) when it comes to my own self . ; ) i just might have to miss this party and hear about all it later . can you explain what this means ? ? ? :) it sounds insightful but i don't understand yet ! hanging on to my undies , - c dear n2freedom , i can't stop believing that you are really a closet enfp who relies heavily on her t and has a fascinating penchant for getting s - - - done . i secretly take your instinct to listen ... dear istp , sorry ... sometimes we have a slight tendency to overreact . : ) you help bring us down to planet earth . love , enfp i hope you find ways to say all this to him ... and to hear his response , too . you are so classy . you are a gem , too . that's why he's stuck it out with you . p . s . don't you have a son ? ... if they really like you , they'll never go far . and when they come back they'll be very , very much back . such is how they roll . that's not really it . nobody would put up with that much b . s . just for that . don't believe us . even nfs try to act tough sometimes . : ) i love your guys ' bluntness . i've been on the receiving end of it and it's helped a lot . i think there are just different ways to roll . they all come from caring . i think you guys can also be ... ok last thing ; ) i guess just imagine a person who cares very , very deeply for you . he's full of this really deep and delicate caring for you . but this makes him very vulnerable . he's also not ... this is going to sound crazy , but do you ever think of going for f w / o b ? i think you're going to reply i want my b ! but if you really do care about him and want to see what's possible with him , ... i am pretty sure he just needs to know that you're not going to try and hurt him , and that you'll be patient with him . that you see when he's genuinely trying . a lot of times they get ripped a new ... p . s . but $ 5 says you'll hear from him again , either way . you always do ! ! he'll be pretending not to care , tho . c'mon woman , you know the drill ! you've been doing it for what , 6 months ? : ) i think it took a lot for him to say so we're broken up now ? just think about that . it might help you get ready to eat some you-know-what . if you want . you present yourself as this badass ...
