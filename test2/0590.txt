' i don't hate commitment , i just don't like people who are clingy . being committed to someone don't necessarily mean that you're forever in shackles . it just depends on the person and whether or not i ... sloths are my favorite . i've been reading brom stoker's dracula and i'm loving it . it is getting a little slow near the end but it's pretty good . how do you fit and differ from istp stereotypes ? i think so . i remember one thing i didn't agree was the one about loving outdoor activities . i like them , but i am too lazy .. haha also , have ... i only seems to figure out who's not the one . i don't like the thin and sleek designs of today's electronic devices :( i like sturdy , rugged , tank-like stuff ... oh , and instagram , i don't like that . i actually like my ( white ) iphone better ... any types and forms of lying , beating around the bush , whining without making any effort , asking / snooping around me to see what i'm up to , sore losers . people who can't mind their own ... assuming the other person knows is dangerous not only when you're dealing with istps but all other people . i would definitely think of the situation as cheating and it's probably a good thing to ... i think i'm pretty much always happy . not the sort of giddy , filled with excitement type of happy but happy nonetheless . i do get annoyed and stuff but that doesn't really make me sad or anything . i ... i internet stalk for two reasons . 1 ) i know things will never work out ever but i'm just curious what he's up to . i don't care or expect to talk to him or anything , it's just meaningless ... well , i personally wouldn't want anyone's help . i'd say just give him some space to think things through . no . i always believed that if i feel i don't love my partner anymore , it's better for both of us to end it . i don't want to force myself to stay if it's clearly not working and i don't the the other ... the only time i don't like being an istp is when dealing with family . i always say something too direct , aloof and analytical when family members need comforting . it's always like ah , shit . a ... i also don't care what consequences my answers will bring . if they have a problem with my answer , it's their problem really . i always forget the question in the middle of answering them ... you know you're an istp when you always want the most durable and rugged design for everything . i hope things get better for you soon . hang in there , man . only if they had some sort of impact on me . i think i remember the dreams where i feel something emotional , like fear , excitement etc . but i think i do forget most of them . i get really depressed when i'm in a situation where i have nothing to do or can't do anything . the feeling of uselessness gets me down so much :'( i feel depressed until i find something to do , then ... i never really encountered cops ( other than for asking for directions ) , but i find them attractive cause they emit a sense of toughness . not sure how many of them could be istps but i'd make a bad ... comfort is always a plus but i don't mind as long as i don't have to sleep on dirt or something . ( but i'd be fine if i was ready for it . ) are you feeling angry and jealous because of something your partner did or does ? if that's the case , you should talk to him and try to fix it . tell him how you feel when certain things happen maybe . ... i got a cool looking , cheap clock and its ticking was waay too loud . i was like meh , i'll try to do something and if it breaks , it's not a big deal , i just liked how it looked anyways . so i opened up ... well , i guess there are some istp ladies here . i actually have the same question , but in finding istp guys haha istps are fascinating , i'd like to meet one in real life myself too . i did play pokemon games when i was little but never finished them . i just prefer watching them on tv . same thing with yugioh or any other types of games like that . i hate memorizing types and names ... from korean to english and vice versa :) hahaha that was hilarious ! i would never be that dedicated enough to do that sort of thing though haha recently , i got a job as a freelance translator to translate youtube videos and it's been super fun even though my pay is pretty pathetic . i'll also be translating a book and that's really exciting ... you know you're an istp when you see an interesting thread in the other subforums , enter it to make a comment , notice things are getting too intense for your liking , leave , then come to istp forum ... that's nice to hear that you're getting sincere support ! wish you the very best in life , sir . oh nooo ... just reading this pains me ... i don't want to ever go through with something like this unless i really loved them for some reason . i wouldn't handle someone like that if i had the chance ... you have to talk to him without getting emotional , that's all . i personally don't mind talking about feelings and things that make me uncomfortable , but if someone is getting too emotional ( angry , ... my god that was hilarious . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHkr2zDZUiI i just watched this and found it really funny haha this literally happens to me all the time ! wytch well , i don't see the point in complaining if you're not going to do anything about it . xfatalxsnipez i would imagine they want to fix it if they're complaining , but they just seem to think ... it's too annoying when people complain about a problem to me and they don't want to do anything about it even when i give them pretty good advice that might actually fix it . what's up with that ? why ... be honest with him and let him decide whether or not he wants to . you can't make it work just because you want it to . bugs . big and tiny . the only time i scream and freak out is when there is a bug present ... i also hate fish heads , they sort of freak me out too . i never want to dance . i think i would have fun as a computer engineer ( hardware ) . or a gem worker . anything where i can work with cool stuff and use my hands to get somewhat creative and have cool outcomes . i think anything can be art . i don't think art has to be something meaningful and serious , or even pleasant . i think art is something that is not natural , but shaped and molded and controlled and ... i wouldn't know , i never met you ! haha i don't mind ldr at all as long as they don't get obsessive and possessive with me . as long as they trust me and i trust them , no problem . to be honest , i'm not that fond of the idea of traveling . as exciting as it must be , i sort of see no point in it . however , i am very interested in actually living abroad for a while because i ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCFJUfXAvXk i'm not sure what psychosomatic pain is exactly , but i think i experienced something similar . when i was younger , i used to get a lot of headaches , stomachaches , and chest pains when i felt ... nooo hahahaha ew lol what kind of hat is that : laughing : tennis skirts ? yay or nay ? https://cdn1.thehunt.com/app/public/system/zine_images/9147660/original/206265396f6af8f007b0bb62f16a5227.jpeg 554642 this is the face i make when my favorite singer in the world is right there . can you feel the excitement ? lol lol well , i hope you get laid this summer too man . i think i'm starting to get over my near 10 year old crush and it feels really weird but good . please move on with your life self , now's your chance ! i guess it would depend on the context . i don't like using emoticons or emojis but i've gotten complaints from other people that i sound too cold when i text haha so i use them a lot now but i ...
