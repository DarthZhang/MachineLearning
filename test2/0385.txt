i sometimes feel like i'm drowning in fi , too , and i've been observing more than i used to . but i can hardly get back to all loud and :D dd even after that particular period . hmm the ... hmm not really . i've pretty much figured out what i wanna do and i still have lots of hobbies and things i wanna do in my free time . i mostly spend my free time doing things i like now . i'm now ... i don't know if it's a phrase or it's like that when enfps grow up ( i'm in mid 20s btw ) , but i've become more and more introverted that i even got tested as an infp twice ( ok i know tests might not ... agree with iemanja . i cut all the connections , including a close mutual friend of us ( any possible ways that remind me of that person tbh ) . making new friends and focusing on a hobby worked for a ... i just finished watching rupunzel and i looove her omg sirius is one of my favourite characters but i can never figure him out . i think he's more like nt to me . aww that's so sweet . i don't remember much being sensitive to my parents ' distress but i was always next to my mum whenever she cried and i'd cry along with her lol i was real naughty when i was ... it reminds me of this chart i found . yeah thanks . i used to have doubts but my friends all told me that it wasn't my fault so it basically doesn't affect me that much now . but it's a bit sad ... : thank you so much for the advice and i ’ m sorry for the late reply as i ’ m usually very busy during the week x_x it ’ s really helpful . i now understand more about the reasons behind my ... i totally agree . i used to be more outgoing and could easily jump from one topic to another in conversations . i've now become more introverted that people even mistake me as an introvert :P i have no ... it's become so natural to me that i think i do it even without realising it lol so i guess the only time that i'm not daydreaming is when i feel like living in the moment - interacting with friends . oh bless this post . i actually started to doubt if i was an enfp at all after all these time , and if it was possible to turn from e to i even though i knew it wasn't supposed to do that . hi i'm the daughter of the said esfj mum and istj dad . my dad is a bit suicidal after he's been bombarded verbally by my very unhealthy esfj mum , and as a daughter , i really hope that i can stop ... yes ! omg i just hit my head on the corner of someone's open locker door at the swimming pool changing room the other day when i stood up from crouching down . speaking of not being aware of the ... i always have the weekend all to myself and do things i enjoy alone after working for the whole week and perhaps sometimes socialising with my colleagues in the evenings on weekdays . i'd get all ... thanks a lot ! it seemed that she was a bit down during that period of isolation and cut herself off . i brought it up to her when she reappeared and she said she wouldn't do it again . ... but i've ... i made a new friend who i worked out to be an isfj . she is surprisingly open in some aspects , like being honest about her feelings ;( hm ... how should i put it . she'd tell me that she's glad to have ... just started off my career as a legal clerk but i'm not sure if i could stay in this field for long once i'm familiar with my work . well , i'm still in the learning process but i could already see ... lol this post managed to make it smile when i was a bit down xd good to know that i wasn't alone though ! let's seee - i poked a 10 years old girl's eye ( which were really dark and i was kinda ... the test was long lol all enfps for me as well . i don't have any enfp friends though ... i actually quite like is :D i agree with almost everything of what others have posted . there are a few that i wanna add : - people who try to make you jealous - people who take what you said too seriously and be critical - ... the problem with being an enfp is that sometimes our ne sees too many possibilities that we can't really make up our mind to fix ourself into a particular field / thing . i'd say try the things that ... i'm such a cry baby that i could cry over the silliest movie like miyazaki's ponyo on the cliff by the sea ... i also remember toy story 3 before they fell into the furnace and harry potter dh1 when ... excuse me if there is a similar topic on the enfp forum but i'm not that advanced in searching for posts so i'm not sure ... anyway , enfps ~ are there any myer briggs type that you find it difficult ... yes . it's changed but she wouldn't know cause we don't really see each other . if it's gonna be superficial , i think it's better to leave it this way :( oh lol i don't think she'll admit her part in this though . hmm i think it'd be best to wait for her to initiate it ( if there'll ever be a chance ) so it'd be easy to get things rolling again .   ... the problem is that i asked her what she wanted upon receiving the present ; and once i got the reply that she wasn't changing her mind , i'd also told her straight up that i didn't want her anymore ... in my opinion , friends aren't something that people could ' find ' or come across with so easily when they want to , especially when they desire to know someone with specific qualities . i think some ... oh believe me , i've also asked myself the same question and even my friends think that it's a good thing that i now have nothing to do with her . but i think it's because of the good times we shared ... yeah , i was also thinking that only time could change the situation as be both become more mature and perhaps be able to realise what we did back then . do you mind me asking how did your friend ... i was trying to figure out my career path and i thought why not take a personally test to understand myself more to see what really suits me ? so i googled it and mbti popped up . after confirming that ... dogs of course !
