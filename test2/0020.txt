' te that's what i meant . anyway i don't know if what i said came off as passive-aggressive but what i meant was that when type 8s get into arguments , it seems like they go all-in without any sort of ... sooo ... one thing i learned today is that you definitely do not want to get in an argument with an 8 . wow you changed it again ! ahh ! i've seen you around and i'm not sure what to do with you but you give me introverted vibes . in my opinion you come off as istp . i just type with the functions . as far as impressions , i'm describing how i typically see the functions working together . i'm just saying there is a tendency from my perspective but i am in no way ... privy because i already started writing it haha 1 . the feeling of realizing that you will never get exactly what you want out of life , and will have to settle for what you can get 2 . passionate ... hmm , yeah . it's hard to put my finger on how i type exactly but if i had to , i'd say i mostly type based off of impression , style , analysis / themes in content , and overall feeling . working out ... just flipped through about 3 pages of your posts and hmm ... definitely an inxx , but nothing jumped out at me as far as having a feeling / fe preference to other functions . you seem to use your ... please do ! i would love to hear your thoughts on everything . : smile : well , the way i interpreted it was that moana experiences a strong sense of destiny in her actions , and that her se can run rampant in times of stress and desperation to see her ni vision through . i ... based off of this response , intj . it's the only remaining type that would make a shred of sense for you . video analysis / theories suggests high ti / te usage , and walking and listening to music of ... i really disagree with you here . all i have to go off of is personal experience and estimation i suppose , but at least from my point of view , i have seen very few true infjs irl , and a ... interesting ! anyway i think it's awesome of you to be so analytical and not afraid to test your ideas against the masses . theory talk is great . i love when posts make me think . keep it up ! well , it is uncommon . according to a poll of 446 infjs , only 1.79 % of infjs were found to be 8s . it's a very rare mbti + ennea pairing for what is already a very rare mbti type . anyway i think there ... mostly i see infjs putting extra ni + ti into their conversations ( ni to be interesting to a ne-dom , ti to relate to entps more ) , and entps putting extra ne + fe into their conversations ( once again ne ... my complaint about estps ... hmm . first , i want to start out by saying i love estps and get along with them great . i've befriended several estps . they bring out the ti + se in me and i bring out the ... hmmm ... i don't think your conclusions are quite right , as i see esfjs / isfjs as pretty accepting of authority most of the time , and this seems like a big loophole . i also don't see isfps as very ... trying to gather the facts in the situation in order to assess what is happening and make the next decision is rather te , possibly te + si . that's what i picked up here : all kinds of gathering facts ... 1 . this could be any number of things , but i'm going to go ahead and go with ni because in my opinion , ni-doms are generally much more attracted to psychology / philosophy than most types . i mean , ... something about that feels wrong to me ... you strike me as some sort of st . ni ! planets and space in general always give me a ni feeling . welcome , fellow infj ! : smile : i'm going to give you some links that will help you delve into mbti more , which i have also linked to other members on this subforum . the first thing you need to study ... hi there ! : smile : i'm an infj myself . do be careful though because infj is ( in my opinion ) the most common mistype , with intj after that . so make sure to study to cognitive functions , which are ... well , this is all bad news to me . i've always admired intjs and thought they were really great . : frown : hopefully there's an intj buddy out there for me anyway . interesting ! i'm seeing istp . more than intp for sure . anyway i do think that low fe can seem like fi a lot of the time . that makes sense to me . yeah , i'd go with istp . wow , you really are an inspiration to meek infjs like me , then . if i order something and they get it wrong i always just eat whatever i get haha because i don't want to make the waiter / etc . feel bad ... interesting . well , do you have a cognitive functions test result you can show me ? because i'm interested now not yet , unfortunately , but i would definitely consider joining one . i would be their most enthusiastic member . : biggrin : oh , i didn't even know that was a thing . you have to have 15 responses ... please don't kill me mother : ixfj 9w1 ( she's weird--she'd either be a bizarre infj or a bizarre isfj ) father : istj 8w9 older brother : intj 5w6 twin sister : enfp 7w6 ehh i don't think it's affected me that much . i ... whoa ! you're an infj 8w7 ? whaaat ! who are you ? ? can you explain to me your life ? looked through your posts and you strike me as more of an isfp . not necessarily introverted but higher in fi + ni , lower in se + te . yes , i am generalizing somewhat . i agree . but i think the premise of the question sort of ( why do estps get hated on the most ) requires generalization . it's impossible to answer otherwise . of ... [ / font ] interesting ! i agree with the categorizing thing . i've also said that i think that a lot of how my mind works ( of course this is speculative ) is by sort of picking out things that give me ... oh trust me , you would love it . it's absolutely beautiful , has one of the highest concentrations of wildlife in the world , etc etc . unlike the u . s . for example where you just see maybe 2-3 non-bird ... hmm ... that's a weird conclusion . pretty much all of the estps i've known were really blunt , unless they were absolutely charming it up haha . but i haven't seen an estp that is really offended by ... no , i don't think you're overthinking ... but i think your friend feels a little betrayed and i definitely think you should apologize , but she should forgive you ! so don't worry . anyway , to answer ... really ? ? i see people hating on estjs , esfjs , sometimes esfps but haven't seen that sort of thing towards estps . personally , they're one of my favorite types ! i see them as fun , charming , and ... ahh , okay . yeah , i just had a feeling . anyway what do you think about the idea of potentially being an infp ? 7w6 3w2 1w9 interesting theory ! my current theory is ni + se but i'm extremely interested now . do you have any examples / explanations / etc ? i want to hear more . my personal favorite is howl's moving castle . ... i would love to visit japan someday too ! there's just something so unique about its culture--something that i think suits an infj really well . i mean honestly , if you broke down the functions and ... ehhh 2000 ' s kid . i was born in the late 90 ' s and i call myself a 90 ' s baby and a 2000 ' s kid . i disagree with a lot of people that say that if you weren't born the decade before or exactly as the ... personally , i don't say anything . it doesn't bother me much . i mean i'll think the person is a little rude but it's not worth saying anything for me . question : do you guys think it's okay for ... yeah , i can see you getting thinking types . i bet you get intj and intp a lot . that being said , i'd wager you're an infp 5w4 . hmmm ... i agree with you there . i was thinking about that as i was writing it , that just describing it as wanting comfort / happiness wasn't ... quite right . i think it manifests itself through ... te i mean i think you could be using ti / si more than ne / fe . just a hunch . i'm so glad that you enjoyed and related to my post ! it's incredibly freeing to find others who relate to what i consider to be a fairly specific / obscure emotion ... but such an important one .   ... hmm , i don't know with you ... you do seem to have se in your stack somewhere , and seem ni to me--tert or higher . you feel like an introvert . i'm going to say you're probably right . : smile : but ...
