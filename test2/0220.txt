( counts on the other introverts not to cross-verify the details ) . i missed you all ! :( : sad : and ... you flatter yourself . but alright , i'll play along . you are right . she needs you ! you are the key to release us from the shackles of boredom . :D voice please . :P sounds like a plan . though i may disappear in between for an hour or so . :) now , who has called ? and why aren't you speaking ? : o whenever you are ready , disguise . :) though personally , i prefer a voice chat first . :P nope , fepa just needs her downtime . go for swimming alone for a few hours . introspect then . you'll feel naturally refreshed . its almost like we drown away our negativities in the water and emerge ... don't worry fepa , i'm right here . * hugs * i read your education background . woah ! : o i hope i did mention i'm gonna pursue biotechnology as an undergrad soon ? i find your story educating , ... what you just described is a shy enfp . :P or maybe my generalization is wrong , but i am mostly like that till i don't get to know the person well enough . post that its pure shameless flirtation . :) ... well when the discussion was at russia , i was gonna type something interesting enough to derail that thought process . :P then fepa did the dirty work , with her ' ' intuition ' ' link . so now , unless ... being an enfp , i myself am often surprised by our shameless flirtation . :D but honestly , i love it at the same time . : laughing : but do you agree that many introverts deem themselves more social after taking a shot or two ? :) what about all the other ixxx here ? what do you guys feel ? oh you wouldn't know darling . :P but generally , do you drink ? i wish to debate that most introverts are predisposed to drinking for socializing . :) depends on a few factors . one : how good did the mirror say you look ? ;) two : any alcohol around ? i won't drink , but litok and the other introverts could sure use a bottoms-up on hard liquor . :P ... and this is why i love fepa . she understands me so well ! : blushed : you know what they said ? i asked them if they'd like to go on a call , cause i was sick of typing so much and such a slow ... please come on skype soon , fepa . :P introverts driving me crazy . i'm like a nocturnal animal partying in daylight ! > . < miss you . : sad : fepa , wtf happened on the skype group last night ?
