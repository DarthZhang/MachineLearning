' i've had the privilege to date two intjs , and it was awesome . i think being ne dominant , the lack of se use i have is frustrating . i'm always so detached from the present moment . my brother used to call me spillin ' dylan growing up because i knocked shit over ... she's absolutely an introvert , i would agree with isfp . you should know as an enfp to give us a link to help other lazy enfps like me . lol , i thought they were equally cool things .. i'd probably choose the batmobile too though . are we even better friends now that i know you exist ? :D http://youtu.be/UBTUAHGpQqE http://youtu.be/DtZp7MQE2ZM it's no measure of good health to be well adjusted to a sick society . ahahahah ^ pulp fiction , whatever hate me if it's too obvious it's the best . i'm actually having a weird surprisingly hard time with this deli meat question , i didn't even think about it ... enxp enfp 3w2 i usually always try and diffuse the situation . however , one time a few friends and i were trespassing big deal , we weren't vandalizing . i couldn't take the security guard seriously ... my type is known for sexual promiscuity . half of yours on the forum on the other hand are probably enfps as well . be my friend ! ? 1 ? is that how this works ? i've never been this unpopular in my life before . we can start the introductions with your favorite quintin tarantino movie along with your favorite cut ... you'd know something about fucking if you got out of the basement ;D yeah absolutely . for the most part i always feel like i have to be entertaining to people . i hate awkward silences or when it's clear that people in the room are not having a good time , it drives ... his sister at one point was going through a bad divorce and what not . he told me , i just can't have fun knowing she's having such a bad time . my esfj father figure feels bad if he has the chance to go out and have fun when he knows someone else is having a bad time . i don't understand lol . you sound like an entp to me . ne can be confusing with te but you said yourself you're more interested in the ideas than the actual implementation of them for the most part . they both sound like isfps . yo someone flip to usa network , i think burn notice is on ahah . on a serious matter , i have a good female isfj friend . she got pretty upset when i told her we weren't very compatible people ... the bird mummies of natron : lake's waters petrify animals that fall in - nbc news.com lake natron has a mixture of salty water and volcanic ash , calcifying animals . i said other . i thought of making fun of someones lame / narrow music choice haha . i'm enfp with a half sleeve and a smaller forearm piece . the friends of mine with the most tattoos are entj , intj , xnfps , and esfp . i'll usually try to find their dominant cognitive function first , it kind of all aligns in place after that usually . psychedelic drugs . i did muay thai for about two years . i normally don't want to think about punching people but it was a great experience . i learned a bit about the thai culture doing it as well . all types can get ... i'm in the tech start up community where i live myself . read the biography , watch the movie , they're both good . i actually think isteve with justin long was kind of funny lol . no way he was either of those . my theory is he was an unhealthy enfp with an fi and te loop . making his functions ne / te / fi / si . his vision and creativity ( ne ) was always being constantly rationalised ... entj > entp > and with further reasoning enfp . when i took the test initially entj with the whole executive archetype appealed to me . i then looked into the j / p divide and realized there's no way ... hey , i'm probably an enfp just trying to fit in on the forum . p's just know how to party . i have two ne dom teachers . and of course this is just a case by case basis , but mine even when they get off topic it's still somewhat relevant to the subject or material , and i can still grasp it ... you definitely have to know the person a decent amount , otherwise yeah you'll get the weird look haha . they it eat it up ! xd absolutely . my best friend is cognitively an entj , however when i first typed him i was thinking about intj . cognitive functions are all different person to person , his te is really constructive ... you mean the introverted judging functions with ni and si ? you make a good point with ti though too . because honestly my intp friend tells me that he represses his ne aux with his ti because he ... personally i think ne is the one that sticks out the most . i can usually tell once i start talking to them , there's just that weird rapid connection through ideas and concepts . i can almost tell ... life is just all fun don't get mad at me duder i'm just living more . both of my last girlfriends were intjs . it made so much sense , especially with the connection i had with the first one that i just couldn't explain . ni dom women make me blush haha . 20 years old , 17 people . ahahah , man i'm a whore . being an ne dom i just can't even imagine being confused for being an fe dom . you might be confusing fi for fe in the sense that you want to create harmony with others , it's just how you go about ... - what is your mbti type ?
