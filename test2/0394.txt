' i'm very conscious of all of my values . i just don't feel the need to tell people or make them agree with mine . two things i value are art and my privacy . it's good to hear you're okay . the hurricanes have been destroying everything and i'm hearing rumours there is gonna be another one . how are you ? both types can be 4w3s , but it is significantly more common in infps than infjs - the latter appearing to have a more level presence among the enneagram types in various polls . whereas infps tend to ... when did you have your first relationship ( < 20 , 20-25 , 26-30 , > 30 ) ? i haven't . what do you look for in a partner ? i want to be able to trust them and feel completely at ease around them , my ... i think 4w3 descriptions really throw people off . you basically repeated everything i imagined would draw you to 4w3 . people read ' i feel unique and that i've never fit in and have been understood by ... most of the things you have mentioned are generically connected to infjs - they aren't very specific nor convincing unfortunately . also , the way that infjs tend to be idealistic is not the same ... the information you have provided is surprisingly vague and could be applied to most people . i would take a wild guess and say : friend a : not an infj , but an isfj friend b : possibly an infj ... his constant attempts at trying to be eloquently poetic are a turn-off and they do feel natural - they feel revised and scripted . just like most people i see making mbti videos , parts of what he says ... i almost wholeheartedly agreed with you until you said you relate to 2 thought patterns and desires mostly and to 1 thought patterns and desires when stressed . it's possible that if you're stressed ... i agree with what has already been said . we don't know the situation so there's nothing we could give advice about . sometimes i ask myself the same question - and others too . i deal with many different mediums too . i practice fine art but i also write . and bizarrely enough , i almost never experience art block ... agnostic atheist . i thank the fact this thread gives me a much needed break from saccharine religious infj threads . not really , no . i don't think the majority of people i come into contact with deserve to know even that much about me . i hate double posts :( i've definitely had my worst experiences in life with people who i felt were ' threatened ' by their inability to read me . these are mostly by other fe users and estps are a part of that group . i ... unless it's something dire , like i don't understand completely how to do something at work or something that would affect others , not asking for help would be stupid in these instances . but if it ... that's not a shocker considering how badly you wrote this thread . did you seriously expect better responses ? that's the most shocking thing of all . you're describing synesthesia . and yes . although some will debate how true a thing it even is . ' too logical ' how ? by that do you mean they don't enjoy the same topics that you do ? like creative subjects for example ? maybe the culture of where you live is predominately that way , especially ... i wouldn't . ever . but that's just me . in my experiences with istps they sound similar to what you have said . they don't seem bothered when the relationship is actually going on but when ... most infjs with practice are , yes . we're not perfect , but we're pretty proficient at it because ni-fe is very attuned to the subtle , non-verbal cues that people present in their microexpressions , ... when i do remember my dreams , they are always surreal and never realistic so it is often easy to tell i'm dreaming at some point towards the end . frequently my dreams are violent , gory or simply ... ah . never been in love . but i am curious to hear what others have to say : kitteh : i can't honestly read all of that text . from glossing over , every sentence my eyes touched made me think intj . their genuine , often child-like enthusiasm and wonder for subjects that interest them . their often high level of energy that feeds my naturally lower energy . how complimentary and flirtatious ... do you have trauma connected to men that could be responsible for this feeling ? or is there something you feel men don't give you , or alternatively do give you , in interactions that differs from ... we probably realise things at different rates . sometimes other people before me ( especially if it's se related and literally right in front of eyes ) . and sometimes i realise before them , but i don't ... i have read your answer multiple times and i still can't fathom how you thought anything good would come of this relationship when your ex is still the primary thing blocking you from focusing on ... i wouldn't restrict ' the one ' coming into my life based on type . if they happened to be a type that , so far i've only had bad experiences with , so be it . so long as they make me happy . but i can very ... i hope whatever awesomeness you have managed to stumble upon lasts a very long time then : laughing : lol - accurate way of describing the ti doms ' interviewing tactics : frustrating : ti is such an experimental , poking-prodding , question-asking function that it can come across in an off-putting way ... intps have a tendency to make me feel like i'm being interrogated or interviewed and it isn't a nice feeling . when you point it out to them , most of them don't realise it . like , the vast majority - ... many of the things you are mentioning seem like an infj-infj relationship issue that is illustrated here : the other day we were out getting food , i felt this distance again and we were hardly ... are you aware of the things that help you when you're stressed / sad / need advice ? if you have that tool-set in mind , you can tell her what will and won't help you during those times . whether it is ... extremely so . i've always had a thing for highly sarcastic , self-deprecating and taboo humour . humour that tends to make most people squirm makes me laugh . i'm much a fan of comedian frankie boyle ... siryl tps can be a dangerous one to go for as they tend to be intellectual but very lazy - so likely you will do all of the mundane things like cleaning , cooking , paying for the bills on time ... i'm going to be completely honest with you . i do not ask for help . people ask me for help . i figure it out on my own because i refuse to risk looking like i needed help or looking helpless or ... i've met quite a number of entp and enfp people and it does make me worry , am i doomed to have the same relationship issues if i continue to be willing to let them around me ? despite their issues , ... this is a weird thread . i don't think most of us struggle to find employment . i'm not a sjw , nor have i ever been that way inclined . nor , do i have to agree with every political view you might have in order to be civil with you or anyone else . if you can only be friends with ... i've never had a conflict with an intj in my life about them not liking people that i do , or vice versa . so i can't relate to your claim . intjs are not alien , nor are they difficult to figure out ... i've never thought that hard logic wins an argument alone , but my ti is not something i would sacrifice , nor ignore or devalue , for any reason . i respect my use of ti just as i respect my ni-fe ... god , ' dirty ' is a good way to describe the feeling they give me . it's certainly not pleasant . like there's something wrong with your very being if you're not processing information and coming to ... i so relate to the conversations you have relayed - like majorly . among many reasons for conflict , i've found many of my intj conflicts irl have happened because on the inside , intjs can be more ... i have seen your posts , but not enough about your personality to guess . i know more about events you have mentioned than anything else . if you want to have a more in depth discussion so that i can ... i don't know you well enough to guess either way . if we interacted more , i might have a stronger opinion on the subject . no , but i can see why you might think so . i suspect intj - te user at least . i have zero issues with adult jokes in children's movies . but yes , frollo is a creep . what leaves a bitter taste in my mouth is the only beautiful people deserve a happy ending , feeling that the ... my mum is an asshole sometimes . screaming at people while they're trying to work because you want attention like a toddler is absurd . fuck off and do something with your life . you wonder why you ... you put this so well . sometimes the infp idealism i've come into contact with , more than not , is like i'm being interviewed for a position of best , most moral , most amazing person in the world . in ...
