last year , i fell into a severe depression . i was even being pursued by a man ( he wasn't right for me ) . i didn't care about being in a long-term relationship for a while . it wasn't even on my radar ... i so wish this could be true ! the title of the thread is intended to invite deflating ... but i'm just sayin ' . just went through a round with someone i was interested that didn't work out ... this merry-go-round is tiring and ... i'm so bad like this . i carry relationship inside my head , not realizing that the other person has no interest or has moved on . but i do think thoughts matter . they influence our energy , our ... yes , it's that she is ill and she loves her husband dearly . she credits him with getting her through this . that's right . i have to remind myself it's what you do that matters ; not what you think . i've admired the way she carries herself , with such courage , that maybe i've idealized her a bit . she adores ... my friend's friend is terminally ill . we've met on several occasions and i've always enjoyed her company . i met her husband at a party recently - - and dammit , i'm attracted to him . he is an outgoing , ... i've often heard life always doesn't hand you what you want . people use it in the context of not getting a bigger car or larger house . growing up , i thought i can accept that . i will work towards ... remember this rule : the best batters have an . 325 era . which means you won't get a hit 2 out of 3 times . this is the rule . keep this in mind and you won't take rejection personally . i'm a chick and ... i didn't understand this comment . fuck yes . in a similar way , it's like when i came back last year . she would not / could not accept that i didn't want to interact . maybe it's guilt . i just don't understand why i can't be chirpy around her , say hi , be cheery and move on . i've taken to avoiding her because i don't want to get sucked into her vibe . last time at a ... yeah rebecca . m - - that sounds about right . seems to me i am not the only one she'd harbour resentments towards . like i said , she has to be the centre of emotional attentin / intimacy that's the part that puzzles me . it's a vibe really . controlling and self-centred . it's not that she is actively asking me to join in now . but she demands emotional intimacy . if i want to keep to myself or keep things to small talk , it pisses her off . it's the control part i can't stand . there's a guy in town i dated briefly . he was so needy that i broke it off quick . he was always wanted to know how i felt about him , see if other men were asking ... now that i look back on it , karen's done things that seem very high school . i passed it off at the time as small-town culture . like i was organizing a social club and invited her to join , among many ... it's like going to the dentist . dread it and avoid or suck it up and get over it . you're just so wrong . absolutely wrong . you sound like you've got a lot of anger yourself that you haven't dealt with . it's blinding you . nope . just do it , quick and painless . remember : there are different types of approaches ( soft vs hard sell ) . talk to the girl about general interests ( if she engages , she likes you ) . ask her if she's ... thanks . yeah maybe it's a matter of forgiveness . maybe we're just different . i should accept that . i am not sure how to handle this relationship question . it's not about romance ( for once ! ) . there is a woman in town , karen , that i became friends with . since it's a small town , we ran into each ... i'm a cautious careful person who is an adventurer . sounds like a contradiction but it means once i go through with my risky project , i go what the hell was i thinking ? i adore that poem - - ... as time draws close , i begin to doubt my judgment ... maybe my friend was right . maybe it's why i haven't been able to meet someone he also has two children , one of whom is very quiet and the other who is very emotional . surely he learned to read the signs there . but it's not just the body language , he also doesn't believe in ... i felt like a crazy person trying to convince a sane person that something was true . i kept wanting to say why can't you see it ? he kept using the word evidence . he says sometimes i don't have ... i think enfj . he is very in-tune emotionally but he doesn't get the dynamics of attraction . he admits to being baffled . i'm baffled that he's been married 20 years and doesn't get it . thanks . i won't be meeting this guy until later this week . yeah i'm miffed . still miffed . jack doesn't understand how staring into someone's eyes is a sign of attraction but really , jack is fucking clueless . unless it's logical and verbal , he doesn't buy . which makes me wonder how he's managed to survive being a public school teacher and as a consequence , doesn't quite believe me when i tell him xyz is attracted to me even if xyz didn't come out and say it . jack is a dear friend of mine and a sensitive new age male . he has ... just afraid it won't work . i am so used to being let down by guys or having men tell me how great i am , that they'll always be there for me - - then they get cold feet and disappear . i've learned to ... she says he loved this quiet , beautiful serious girl , and that he recognized me ( whatever that means ) we've met a few times actually but since i wasn't open to the possibility of romance ( long story ) i didn't recognize his behaviours . she told me this to understand why he's acting the way he has ... there's a guy who's part of my social circle . i like him a lot , he's a great guy . i dont see him much because he lives out of town . a friend of ours recently informed me that this guy loved me from ... adrien brody is dreamy . is he as cool irl as i would hope ?
