? for example , mine tend to be things like trying too ... that's almost exactly like me . externally in social situations , i seem laid back and easy going and easy to get a long with . but internally , im freaking out due to overloads of everything around , ... for me , it depends on what's bugging me . usually i don't speak up when somethings bugging me because i dont really like conflict nor do i want to cause issues , so i tend to internalize most things ... that's where my question came up is what we did was planned out and everything , but it wasnt defined as either one by either of us thats true ya i see that would be the easiest and quickest way to find out . but i have enough issues just not getting nervous and whatnot around this girl not to sem weird to answer my own post , but yes im still concerned with this fine line , as it has gotten reblurred when i invited the girl ( the one mentioned before in here ) to come to my college's ... i'm sure we all just mentally shook our heads lol . but i get hat he means about people doing crazy things . someone i knew last year had never seen snow before , so they took a sled and went down the ... things may or may not get better as one of my friends convinced me to join my colleges student activities club ( the club responsible for on campus student activities like speakers , dances , etc ) . they ... i have to agree with the posts about coming off scary until people get to know you . my best friend from high school almost didnt become my friend cuz of the first impression oh believe me , college is a freaking nightmare . i go to a private college ( maybe 1500 students total ) that is located near me as i live at home still . but i am in my second year and its starting ... what if it's not by choice though ? part of my reason is purely cost based , i couldnt afford the dorms . but thats what i'm talking about , people assume that living off campus i want left out when i ... true there , i'm not totally sure how to describe it , but it just feels like i sorta feel disconnect from people because i dont live in the the dorms , i'm not into the whole get drunk on the weekends ... just curious , those of you infj's currently in or who have gone to college , did you ever feel a bit disconnected from everybody ? did few people want to socialize with you because they saw you as ... i do have the issue of social anxiety but i think my friend groups have helped . while i hate interacting around large groups , im fine in classes and hallways and i'm known by some as the most ... maybe not so much with the violent stuff , but i get lots of these thoughts . every situation i go into , i immediatley get the thought of the worst possible thing that could happen . such as the day ... i do have severe s . a . d .. i've been working for over a year to handle it , but when i get anxious , i get super sweaty and nervous over the little things , which then leads to a insecurity-like feeling , ... makes a ton of sense there . so basically being shy is a sometime unconscious response , or programming , to something in the past ( mistakes , failures , humiliations , simple misunderstandings ) rather ... but can't a person unconsciously act shy ?
