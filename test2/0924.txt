' no . the act of picking up smoking in this day and age is nearly inexcusable . you almost have to be incompetent to do so . there aren't that many poor decisions you need to avoid in life , but smoking ... this just happened to me . the concept was perfectly clear in my head , but when asked to explain , the explanation started to mush and dissipate , resulting in me looking like i wasn't really sure what ... well that's unfortunate . anyway , i'm referring to those who want to be their image of the intj . who doesn't want to play the role of the mastermind in our little group play ? i don't know if it's a manifestation of the functions , but i also do this , by and large . the ultimate consequences from certain actions seem all too damaging after some consideration . of course , that ... double post , but i'll add another . when people say what they don't really think . an example would be someone being unreasonably troublesome , and others trying to say things to make him feel better ... i dislike it when people state the obvious or say irrelevant things . neither are productive nor useful . when you use analogies and metaphors without realizing it . obliviousness to the consequences of one's actions , or moral disengagement from them . ( example : isfj ) look at the middle letters ( sf ) to find the dom & aux functions . one will be perceiving ( n or s ) and one will be judging ( t or f ) . keep in mind the judging function ( f ) . now ... when you've experienced a dreadful ni-fi loop . or several . ( go home ni you're drunk . ) edit : oh , it appears that op didn't actually want to be offended . stating that they are less likely than other types is perfectly valid and widely accepted to be true . making the claim that they cannot would not be . this example should be clearly different from ... why state a given ? it's irrelevant . 1 . how did you find out your type ? how long did it take ? i initially took tests like many others , but gradually realized their ineffectiveness as a means of pinpointing one's type . i was able to ... technically , i say things i sincerely don't mean . they just come in a form of sarcasm . but in the spirit of the thread : i prefer to not have goals in life . it helps me to relax and take it easy . clyme makes a great point on the distinction between agnostic / gnostic and atheist / theist . the misuse of the distinction has bothered me for some time . intps everywhere . yes . i imagine intjs to not care not only because there is no empirical data to support the concept and because it's impossible to find the answer , but also because it's ... some negatives , from my observations : strong values that they tend to push onto others and a minimal tolerance for disagreement . constant self-blame and regret of past actions . they are strongly ... it's fantastic that you care about other people being mistyped . really , it is . feather projection the power to project razor-sharp feathers as projectile weapons . fabulous . i don't think you should do this to your dad . i may have argued the same way as you in the past , but after realizing that people are different and that certain things that matter to them can cause ... it pretty much depends on how much they care . which is naturally a crapshoot . so probably not . green girl gasmgizmo i see . wasn't expecting to get hit by a fallacy , but i can see how it would be difficult to prove . i have my own reasons for believing they exist , but that means nothing from ... not yet . i wasn't aware we had a choice . when you're rational but get irrational fears . you make strong claims . what is your evidence for doing so ? it sounds ... isn't very convincing ... the fi guilt thread ? primarily for its visual qualities . sometimes it's fun to pick out themes in shows . i had some fun with shinsekai yori and psycho-pass . 1 ) do you like tea ? specifically hot tea sure . mainly green and black . 2 ) do you often think about society and how downhill it is going ? ( of course thats a loaded and assumptious question ) - more ... i wonder what defines an immature intj . i perceive an immature intj to be like myself . rational , but condescending and egoistic . are you sure that those immature intjs you speak of are in fact ... cski allow me to explain . rabbits by nature are known to , well , * * * like rabbits . seeing a rabbit being abstinent would appear to be defying of its very nature . almost a paradox , if you will . i ... jeb i apologize for this unfortunate turn of events . i will make my best efforts to learn from your patience to avoid similar situations in the future . with respect to that conversation , it was in response to his insulting tone : nonetheless , i have been condescending and sarcastic throughout this thread , and i apologize . i will strive to ... i was originally going to post this , but i didn't want to categorize them into absolutes . i would have called myself immature . apolo the probability of an instance occurring ( a christian intj ) due to given known factors ( intj functions and characteristics of organized religion ) has no relevance to the probability of your gf ... those that hate dealing in absolutes and those that don't . ( joking . i found xleonhart's thread on the two nihilist types interesting and relatable . ) i approached te based on my understanding of itself as a function , its apparent influence on types , and my own observations of the function . to me , your interpretation makes no sense whereas ... sptheghost well put . the fact that it can happen is a given . i don't think anyone logical will make the claim that it can't . personally , i was religious as a child , as well . allow me to reiterate . this isn't about me , your christian intj girlfriend , or any other alleged intj . like the issue with starscream's credentials for testing as an intj above , it cannot be proven ... stargazing grasshopper may be trolling . either way , his comments make no sense . i believe courtneyjd has the right idea . te is looking for empirical data ( observable , measurable facts ) to reach ... ignoring all of the obvious responses already made , the phenomenon ( assuming it's real ) could be a result of the intj's functions . i sometimes wonder if intjs are particularly susceptible to ... your credentials are not empirical , as it is the accepted notion that mbti tests are not even within the ballpark of being 100 % accurate , and for that reason cannot be treated as such [ insert ironic ... yes , the fact that your gf has numerous biology-related degrees , is a medical doctor , and is an alleged intj makes it that much more likely for intjs to become christian . admittedly , i have considered this and toyed with the idea , although the resultant concepts adhere heavily to my personal values rather than for the mere sake of control . in short , they are for the ... yes , because the functions of the intj are conducive to the adoption of organized religion . you should know that this is a meaningless pursuit . i'd love to hear his response , though . christian ... hello sinon , or should i say shino . hopefully you'll learn a lot about yourself and other personalities here . there's a wealth of informative posts on the forums , so take your time and enjoy yourself . what a christian intj looks like ? might as well ask what an abstinent rabbit looks like . no . for me , the cons outweigh the pros . haha . when capri-sun , gushers , chuckie , alien , and bagel bites collide . edit : added this because i laughed ( source : / r / funny ) lost toys - imgur '
