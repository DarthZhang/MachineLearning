i think you are introvert . hahaha my first assumption was also esfj but i couldn't find confirmation and i don't trust my hunches . and this is a reason why i didn't write about this before : blushed : i see s very often in ... so we talking about you . just fill up questionnaire : rolleyes : could you elaborate , how you get to this point ? yes . one letter . i think you are estp . definitely extrovert . my first assumption : estp or estj . you are not a intp . you are people oriented person , mean f . it is stereotype . i am nt and i am not interested in math and physics but many sf or st are interested in math and philosophy .  ... istp are very reserved and quiet . even more then intp but there are more outgoing and they have crazy moments . intp are most socially awkward from all 16 types : laughing : i see mbti will ... take your time . there are 4 possibilities to check : si-ne , ne-si , se-ni , ni-se you are only 16 and your dominant function probably is not developed yet . take your time . there are 4 possibilities to check : si-ne , ne-si , se-ni , ni-se 30 seconds on internet : example : the four types of scientists 1 . the data-driven nerd / myers-briggs istj ( yes , that â€™ s my type ) or istp ( see comment below ): these are guys and gals who seem to ... therefore we agree you are fe-ti or ti-fe user . moreover you are extrovert . estp , entp , esfj , enfj now you have to read about se-ni , si-ne functions . which fits you better ? i only said you use se often then ni . you are introvert so you dominat function is ti . extroverts have dominant function se and auxiliary ti . dom . - - - auxiliarly ti - - - - se ... xnewix you wrote esfj but function are fe - si-ne-ti . and you recognised se in a few answers . so ... could you elaborate ? it's a hunch ? your question also shows se . - asking for specific details to perceive the pattern se and ni are always together . one of the functions is stronger . so we have only 2 combinations se-ni or ... lots of fe . i see also se . you talking about experience and adventures . so i vote on estp . wontlookdown , why are doubt you are entp ?

could you fill up questionnaire . entj or estp . you seem extrovert . read your answer on no . 2 question . you took control over all situation . you've been directive and decisive . non all extroverts like crowds . my 2 cents then : estj : vrook lamar , saul karath , canderous esfj : carth onasi esfp : attond rand , malak enfj : revan ( he's such a fe :) enfp : mission vao istj : bastilia shan , zaalbar istp : ... we are agree she is inxx . it is hard to say more right now . she wrote she feel like an alien not her friend : wink : i am agree with eikichi - esfp or isfp . i think you are extrovert . i am glad you found your type . if you want know more here is isfj forum isfj forum - the nurturers . you seem a istj and many 6 ' s are istj . so for your analitical skills , that's cognitive functions : isfj - si > fe > ti > ne istj - si > te > fi > ne istj and isfj look similar . you have to ... unhealty istp with develop ni . she can be intp . how about small talk . does she like it ?
