( from the hilltops ) you made some great points in your whole post but i really liked how you wrapped it up . i think this is one thing this thread has been trying to get at the whole time ... it seems that an isfj can truly blossom when they have gained confidence in their own skin . it opens up so many doors . but it does happen in baby steps . the transformation is amazing when it happens ... slowly starve here and there ... haha thanks for your response ! by this i just meant - do your close friends provide these things for you ? if so , how ? also , are these things a need of yours in a close friendship ? yes ! i definitely ... kristi yamaguchi , kirsten dunst , kate middleton , michael cane , halle berry , christopher walken , jimmy stewart hello everyone :) i have been trying to catch up on reading all that has been posted , so that is why you haven't heard from me in awhile . this thread has been very interesting for me and i too am glad ... what if you're just imagining there is a half a pizza there ? what if you took a bite and then became cursed ? : 0 and then ... you had to eat pizza the rest of your life because a your fridge turned into ... i actually have noticed this about myself and sometimes felt weird about it , now knowing how to stop ... however i don't really think it is something i need to stop . i even sometimes worry about how i ... i agree with what you are saying here - i think you make some valid points . much of this has already been mentioned in the thread , especially in a lot of teddy's posts . i think it will give you a ... yeah i definitely think it is good to be straight forward in asking an isfj if they like or do not like something because they are going to be less likely to just say it because they don't like ... yes ! i can definitely relate to this . i think it all depends on how much i really see the need to voice my opinion about something or how serious the subject is to me . if it's something that i really ... also a few more that i meant to include that are probably some of the most important i would ever like to hear : i admire that you stand by what you believe regardless of what others may say . you ... yeah i agree with several things mentioned so far . i do like compliments , but as it has been said , they have to be genuine and i would much prefer a compliment about who am as opposed to what i ... hello enfps ! :) it being new years , i find it interesting how different types deal with new years resolutions . so , what kinds of new years resolutions do you enfps make , or do you make any ? ... happy new year infjs ! what kinds of new years resolutions does an infj make ? thanks for your reply ! why do you think it works so well ? what negatives are there ? i've been doing some thinking about the whole surface vs . deep thing . the longer i've been on perc ( which hasn't been long ) , the more i've noticed in various threads the contrast between how ss view ... it's possible we would clash a bit . lol . what brings up this thought ? :) do you want to be an entp ? did you mean isfj ? user name tritype instinctual subtype stephiphi 2w1 , 6w5 , ? sp this makes sense . cool :) good deal , i think it's definitely good to just have time to figure things out ! your dad seems really picky and doesn't sound like a stereotypical isfj . so i could list several kinds of gifts that i like to receive but i don't think they would apply to your dad because we seem ... i would have to agree with you when it comes to infp vs . esfj in dealing with conflict . i have an esfj mother and conflict is terrible with her . i actually can relate to everything you said . it ... i see the similarities in that both types can get emotionally attached to things , but they deal with it differently ( at least me and you ) . i see it as kind of a reverse in this instance ... in your ...
