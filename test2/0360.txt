' thanks :) i think i'm just getting bored of not being at university at the moment that i'm starting to worry about things instead of getting on with it ! hmm that's true , i've just gotta wait out university i guess . after that i'll hopefully be more free to find out what i enjoy doing or whatever . the idea of kids also slightly worries me . they ... haha , that's a very good question . i don't really know what i'm interested in . i like the idea of doing things like acting , performing or whatever . i've never actually acted though and have not done ... this ? so i get up every morning , eat , go to work , come home , prepare for the next day . in a few years , i'll likely get married and then probably even more work needs to be done , and if i ever ... i hate phonecalls . i feel uncomfortable not being able to read peoples body language . i also often crack jokes that can be construed as mildly offensive and i don't like the idea that someone might ... never worn make-up ... actually i have ! dressed as a woman for fancy dress once . i wasn't so great at the make-up part either . ohh , also did joker make-up on myself once . gotta love fancy dress xd hehe , of course not ! i do like to waffle . more so in person rather than on computer though , not sure why - maybe that makes me lazy at typing ? what do you think ? mmmm , i want some waffles now :( ... really , nothing like these ? http://www.julesb.co.uk/menswear-1/mens-designer-shoes-15/mens-formal-shoes-98/jeffery-west-black-line-654064-98580_zoom.jpg oh , yeah well i don't mind sneakers but ... hehe , i am a dude yes ! i'm not massively into fashion or anything , just don't want to look like a dork :) hahaha , that made me laugh so thanks =D . the rest is good advice though ! not huge on trying on loads of shoes though , damn fashion is pain huh ? thinking we should maybe have a fashion advice section of the forums ? anywho , i need some new shoes and would like some opinions . i usually wear jeans and want something that goes with them . i'd ... i have very curly hair . it grows into a massive ' fro whenever it gets longer . i hate my curly hair with the fury and passion of a thousand gods ! always get it cut super short with a buzz cutter ... ms tyler durden i presume ? riiight . hello everyone ! much like the title - if you had one chance to do something that you knew you couldn't fail , what would it be ? mayhap i'll answer my own question at some point .  ... why snip them ? you look great ! ! wow . that was amazing . i'm thinking of joining one of the armed forces in the uk and was leaning toward hopefully special forces . you're making me think again . i don't know what to do now . ... when i'm nice and people start to treat me like some sort of doormat and take advantage . that's somewhat annoying . i lose respect for people when they're mean to others for no reason . i didn't get to see ! that's not fair ! ! :( i even posted a pic of me looking awful dressed as a pirate ! you're turn :P ! ! http://personalitycafe.com/enfp-forum-inspirers/43291-enfp-picture-thread.html ohh yanks don't know what that means huh ? it's kinda like how everything that's bad tends to happen instead of things that are good . not very optimistic ! : o examples include : toast landing ... i wanna real picture ! :P nice drawing though :D you look happy ! yeah i get that quite often , i think they call it sods law or something :D i'm actually the turtle ! ... well not actually i'm the guy but yeah . thanks , i actually don't like the photo much , seems lopsided but it's one of my most recent . what do you look like ? isn't that a ... i find it so difficult to divert my attention :( , dunno if that's bad or good . i see what you mean though , thanks man :D how do you mean by divert attention ? i did forgot the last part , i like it though hehe . as for me i'd ask this girl out :D hypocrisy ! yeah i agree , if you guys want to do these things then why don't you plan doing them ? little baby steps towards it would be good . whilst you're young people ! hey man , good post ! there's this girl that i quite like that has been making out with a few different guys recently , guess it made me abit green around the gills ! okay , what about something slightly lesser a big deal than sex . say for example ; you like someone but every time you go clubbing you see them making out with a different person . what would you ... hey guys and dolls , when do you consider is the point at which men become man-whores and women become sluts ? how easy do they have to be ? do you think there's a difference in the way men and ... what i often find is that happiness is a choice . you can choose to look on the bright side of things or you can choose to be sad . bad things happen but when they do you can choose to lie in the dust ... are you considered hot or beautiful or cute by others physical standards ? i don't personally think so . girls have said i'm hot or something similar to that but the only ones that come out ... gotta say ears that do that are sooo cute ! ! where do you guys find all these awesome pictures by the way ? i don't understand where people get such a random selection from . what do you search for ? ahh if you mouse over it , it even says insert image , thanks man :) those were some great pics :) , love the bottom one especially . thanks for sharing :D so i just copy paste the link right in ? do i have to but it in any brackets or anything like quotes or writing things in bold ? domination .. hahahahahahahahahahahahah jokes . but seriously ! nah not really i wouldn't want to be incharge . to spread the love :D . to make at least one person breath easier . something like that . 14605 this looks cool to me , how do you post images so they just appear as normal and not in little thumbnails ? katherine heigl ! ! ! i like her :D that looks a little like my kitten ! as for me i'd probably be some sort of eagle or falcon . the freedom to just fly all over the place would be awesome . maybe being an orca would be cool though ... 14602146 03 these are of me with a nice drink and one in my regular comfortable attire . : laughing : first off i wanna say kudos for being in what sounds like a loving relationship . however i put a few things in bold that i think maybe you should look at . it seems to me from my extensive study ... do enfps really not make good couples ? i like them :( wow , it seems to me that i could have written most of your post ! i've experienced more or less the same thing you have ; the difficulties and the withdrawal as a defense mechanism . i believe that ... you did my friend , thanks :) however what about more trivial things ? like people wanting to eat your food because they've run out of their own and don't want to walk to the shop to buy more , or ... any tips at all ? i feel so mean when i say no . got diagnosed as dyslexic a few years back . doesn't seem to massively impact my spelling and grammar though , i did drill myself quite a lot on it though . math is a different story however , my brain ... personally i don't mind what people do . it's their business , not mine . are you sure they do it on purpose ? maybe they mistyped by accident ? anyway , i digress ... coookkkiieee c ...
