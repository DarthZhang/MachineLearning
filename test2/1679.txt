because all the other interpretations say he has failed for mankind to agree on interpreting him ? so ... these two songs are good examples . the lyrics in closer that say you bring me closer to god sounds like se trying to access ni . as an si user it leaves me with the question , how do physical ... why does this sound more likely ? yes yes yes , we are misunderstood , god damn , holy shit , sooo misunderstood , nobody every gets us . i swear sometimes we just want to be that way , maybe because it gives us something to constantly ... sometimes i do just want to go outside and punch some random dude in the face , that's what repressed anger and not allowing yourself to be angry and assertive will do to you . people say , you ... lol sorry . maybe you need a chest punch though lol . it might make you feel alive for a moment at the very least . when you know the reality , and see someone going through created internal ... yea , it's always a never ending battle to create that dream world in a tangible way . i have small bursts of dream worlds , then i have some very very detailed dream worlds that sort of create ... yea they give you something that's special to who they are , i once gave a girl a hoody i wore everyday to the point where people recognized me by that hoody . she didn't get it lol , but i loved her ... ok i get it , i get why some people look at introverts and want to shake them or force them to do things and talk . there is a new guy at my job and he's so shy with his body language , shoulders ... these are my exact reasons for doing this , and it took awhile for me to realize these were the reasons . it's almost like i had a time of the year where for no reason i would just indulge in negative ... so you can tell they are adjusting themselves to be more like you ? i know i do this with my intj friend , i never suspected he could tell though , i do get a more positive reaction when i just let ... oh that is cool ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1stxUqNJINE hm , sounds like si is very detailed while se is very let go . i actually think njs are close to sps and nps close to sjs . with inferior se i think there is an intense crave for sexual exploration and being taken in the moment , almost knocked out of your ... hm . i think you have a point with si , i didn't know that about se though , and going with the flow . do these functions manifest themselves differently during the act . i know these functions aren't the only factors that determine one's experience during sex . but i would think se is more ... what , no , i don't agree with anything you said since i was just playing devils advocate to allyrah . read my last post again . maybe your right . diamonds could get me a nice car , so diamonds . good or bad ? man tries to trick himself into thinking he is more than a beast so he is surprised when his natural faculties emerge . in that moment of surprise and confusion he actually becomes aware of not just ... maybe fucked up and perverse is normal , and people are just living a righteous lie , hiding the beast until it just acts itself out through their vessels , which they try to deny to uphold the lie that ... it must be tough for you , living amongst the beasts , your soul must rot in their presence . regardless of a flick of the wrist tough love or whatever , the beasts will continue to roam for ages , still ... maybe this is what we all really are , and anything higher than that is some cruel illusion of better ways promised . maybe we are just beasts deep down in denial . after seeing this over and over again ... coming to terms with your own corruption and darkness is a thing to behold . all the things being confronted at once , all the complex shit that is happening is just something to behold . living in ... like i can't live up to the hype , it's not in my nature to be the way i'm wanted to be . and how i want to be , if it's good or bad , i have no idea anymore . and if i start losing any idea i have of ... entjs are probably the only people that really make me want to become a better person . man , oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man , just literally spoke about things i feel in ways i didn't think to speak about them man oh man . i think i need that walk too . i completely get self destructive behavior now . at least in my own way . when you hold so strongly to morals and convictions , they become a heavy weight , sometimes it's a relief to just give into the ... i love the feelings when music makes my whole face numb for a second . in a mood today , a temporary one , but in the middle of it , i'm back to being tired of developing , or trying to develop . i can't hear the words don't give up , keep trying today , all i can here is ... i want to quickly , but when i notice that there are things that the girl says that make me question myself i keep her at arms lenght because i'm struggling with still being interested in her but not ... he's much older than me , our friendship is much like he is the controller of our interactions . he approaches me , he brings up topics , he sets up times and dates , i cannot gauge the areas where i have ... that game sounds like a good idea , probably something he would have to introduce though . i think that's the problem , i feel like he's asking for some goofiness and i just don't know how much so i ... yesss , it sucks . can't just have a stupid normal conversation , what kind of person are you , you can't do regular things like that ? all these thoughts jump into my head and curse my mind . sometimes ... i relate to some of what you say . idk , i just purposefully do weird things to push people away . i think it's because if i have things i can point to and say this or that intentionally pushed them a ... i feel afraid , that feeling when you psyche yourself out into thinking your are gonna let somebody down just by being you . like it's gonna happen sooner or later , might as well just take myself ...
