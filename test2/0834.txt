i find users with fi and ti quite attractive . i don't understand how someone with fe can actually be attractive ? fe makes people focus on the other person's needs and stuff and that makes them appear ... haha . i really don't think i can stand another like this one . but yeah , i'm thankful too that you could give me such an accurate perspective . i wasn't able to let go because i didn't know if i was ... i did . i stopped completely . it'll take me a while to heal , haha . i wouldn't have considered this perspective in a million years . it makes so much sense . i know this was stupid , but i had ... i have been frank with her from the beginning . what you say makes a lot of sense . i just stopped talking or replying to her messages completely now . thanks . i guess i came to the right temperament to ... thanks . hey , guys , i met this isfp ( not n ) who didn't want a relationship because she said that her past ones had hurt her . we ended up staying friends and i didn't mind that . but one day , she sent me a ... hey , guys , i met this isfp who didn't want a relationship because she said that her past ones had hurt her . we ended up staying friends and i didn't mind that . but one day , she sent me a text ... haha . each of those is the equivalent of running a marathon for me . i was watching this kid's show called the last airbender . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02FkMr21xOA a guru teaches the kid that there are seven chakras and that they all flow into each other ... i feel that , sometimes , even if our intuition is right 90 % of the time , we never know when we're wrong because we cannot perceive how we can be wrong . i've been in the grip of se for a long time and ... i'm not an nt , but if anyone's curious . 1 . i'm usually aware of my environment and i don't speak more than i need to . but i do meet the occasional interesting person and get carried away in ... wow . a lot of good advice on this thread . i can relate to this a lot . i think it's because we naturally tend to place value on things that are physically beautiful . i don't know if it's the same for you , but i tend to categorize things based ... ah . okay . i see it now . i've made quite a people uncomfortable by projecting my idealistic view of them , on them . focusing on things that makes us happy instead would make relationships more ... thanks for this . this is pretty much me right now and i guess i need to grow emotionally . but sometimes , i can't help it , because i tend to lose interest in life when there isn't something ... haha , i'd like to know that too . i've noticed that my life tends to revolve around the person i like . everything i do , has something related to it . if i watch a movie for instance , i try to pick up things which might impress them ... glad to help : happy : i think that should be fine , i have a feeling you might manage it well . i think you would be helping her a lot . i usually get a rush when i talk about my pent-up feelings and it gets quite intense and uncontrollable inside . but that state has made me bond like crazy with ... she is lucky to have you . i'm still going through a similar phase and can identify a lot with her . it's quite hard to express who we truly are , because we're scared about how people will perceive ... this is from my perspective of temperaments . feel free to add whatever you feel and correct me wherever i might be wrong . the four temperaments : the guardians , artisans , idealists and rationals ... welcome . it made a huge difference for me too . hope to see you in our forums :) haha , at least that helped clear my doubts if i was an intj . :) :) thanks that would be the super power . i think i'm pretty sure now that i'm not si because i really really hate repetition and routine . i find them absolutely mind numbing and usually escape from activities like that.and i usually get ... i think infps smile from the inside . infjs reflect other people's smiles most of the time . i'm not sure why . the combination gives me a feeling of something that has been untouched for a long time and looking at it could tell me about the people who lived here and the type of life they ... haha , namaste to you too :) and let me know if you ever need help with anything . i will be glad to help too . ditto here . haha , me too . i think it's because i could always tell what they were planning next and would frustrate them by blocking them xd xd . haha , thanks for looking into my post . https://www.flickr.com/photos/alco251/21067616135/ i tend to like pictures like these because they tend to calm me . the mix of old metal and nature always ... that's true . i just wish that there would be someone to reciprocate the same way . i'm pretty much in the same boat too i guess . you have been invaluable to me :) :) hmm . should i post more pictures descriptions to make sure ? repeated what if you try to know if you're a dominant judger or a perceiver ? that might help clear things up a bit . haha , this is exactly how i feel . not to sound like a dreamer , but i wouldn't want anything else if i could find a person like that . haha , you know , the ones in movies like pretty woman , the english patient . :) :) i assumed that i could get close to anybody i wanted and could get the kind of relationship i was looking for , ... i think so . i feel it makes me quite dependent on people and kinda needy . yeah , a romantic relationship . the movie kind haha . haha , i just meant to tell you to try as many types of strategy games as possible . i think averoblivious hit the nail on the head . every type gets tempted to develop their tertiary . it's ... actually , yes . i feel that i cannot live without fantasizing a perfect relationship or idolizing somebody . hey guys . just wanted to know if craving a relationship was something normal or if it was confined to xxfjs or just me haha . haha , i'm pretty sure most of us do . my question was whether you're good at any of them :) :P it might seem so at first glance , but they key to knowing your temperament is finding out what you can't live without . i do enjoy freedom , knowledge , etc , but i absolutely cannot live a life which ... i don't think so . i would rather feel that i had more opportunities than the rest to turn my visions into reality . the temperaments are quite different . each temperament has core needs which they can't live without . artisans ( istps ) cannot live without freedom or an ability to make an impact . rationals ( intps ) ... 1 . wreck-it ralph . 2 . in the land of women . 3 . pretty woman . 4 . sleepless in seattle . 5 . the notebook . :) thanks . you've been a big influence on me . i really hope i will find someone like that too . i wish you the best for all your endeavors and your advice is much appreciated . haha . glad you were able to enjoy it too . thanks . i think i need a little confidence in my own judgement too . i think i'll start off with small steps till i gain confidence in my judgement . thanks for the encouragement . its made a big ... haha . i've been in the same situation quite a few time xd xd
