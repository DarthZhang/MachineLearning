' i love this show , chris lilley is a genius the first thing that jumps to mind is estj for ja'mie , but i can actually see entj working too ... not 100 % sure though oh i agree now ! elsa does seem to have a lot of si .. yeah i am leaning more towards isxj for her . and there really should be more t princesses ! ( maybe tiana from princess and the frog is a t ... but ... loved this movie . these are mostly guesses : anna - i agree with you that she is an enfp ... and i could maaaybe see esfp working too but am leaning more towards the first one . elsa - i saw ... elsa - yeah i agree with infj , i just don't see her being an infp as much because i think she shows more ni than ne and definitely seems to have fe over fi . anna - she was a bit more difficult ... my biggest fear is probably of stagnation or missing out on experiencing things , like staying stuck in the same place / in a rut and just letting time pass by uneventfully , growing old without using ... my guess would be esfp too i always thought simon was an estj , 8w7 ... i don't know that much about him though tbh this show is awesome ! ! ! i agree with axl - estp , sue - enfp , frankie esfj or enfj , mike istj and i am pretty sure brick is an intp . if you're taking the tests that show if you are a i / e , s / n , f / t , p / j i think it's pretty common to change slightly according to your mood or the test itself ... they can be pretty inaccurate ... john i could see as an infp or infj ... so i am more unsure .. :/ but hank seems like an entp ... that would also explain the kind of blurred i / e ... i just think he has slightly more ne than ti but ... love this show ! i think your typings are pretty accurate ! i agree with leonardo being entp i could even see lucrezia being an infj ... but estj works too ... i am not sure ... stuck ... yeah i agree with intp i think she's either esfp or isfp i see se and fi in her ... my guess is esfp ... i love her ! :) not entirely sure about the type though ... but maybe an ne dominant ... ? entp or enfp or maybe i am just being a bit influenced by clara's character ... because i think she's either ... my mum is an isfj and my brother is an istp and we get along very well ! i have no idea what my dad is though ... possibly an esfj or estj not sure though the joker the doctor ( 10 and 11 ) jack sparrow jack skellington willy wonka doc from back to the future tony stark and of course , cheshire cat i was just wondering which types the housemates may be . here are my guesses tim - entp tahan - istp ? jade - isfj drew - infj boog - estp or esfp ed - esfj ? ben - istj ? mikkayla - ... this is the most freakishly accurate thing i have ever read ! chaotic neutral entp sah unique hahaha ;) ♪ you're jean valjean ♪ i just watched les miserables ... simply had to .. :/ https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1150922_492106377542386_826391641_n.jpg paintings i did for school . :) http://24.media.tumblr.com/7e567a27d032edfddd3fb7a58eee0f8a/tumblr_mmug8e2twH1s2so8bo1_1280.pngScarily accurate http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qdNBrzAQjo&feature=player_detailpage i donno ... he shows so much fi in this . but sometimes he does come across as more entp , but i think that is mostly when he ... oh what the heck ... i'll give this a go ... :/ walter white - intj jesse - isfp or esfp ... he seemed to use more se at first but as the series progressed his fi became more apparent . sylar - ... these are just mostly guesses but steve - esfp - i was struggling to see his fi but in the breaking bad broken down he uses it quite a bit ( i think ) . lee - enfp - i just see loooads of ne ... mmm isfp / isfj for issac ? ... it's just a random thought though ... :/ what about peter van houten ? ! i could see both but i think he's more infp . he does interact with people but he seems to do it out of boredom and never seems happy with the interactions either , if anything , his interactions seem ... i defs agree with indiana jones being more of an introvert . good points , i never really considered it that way . i always generally saw solo as someone who was constantly running away from ... yeah i think he's an enfp you guys have so many great characters ! :) i have heard people say he's an estp ... but i can see him being more entp , or even enfp . or maybe i am just biased ... regardless , he's great ! :) when you do 30 minutes worth of work in 8 hours and 8 hours worth of work in 30 minutes . http://images.wikia.com/lesmiserables/images/0/0a/Enjolras-aaron.jpg entj ? ... not 100 % sure though . i agree with sully being estp :) but i think mike is more estj ... he just seems to use so much te i saw this a while ago ... so i actually can't recall what the other characters types were ... but arthur seemed like a complete infp :) love his character :) probs more estp than entp though . i agree with phil as enfp .. i see more ne than se in him . yeah augustus seems like a perfect example of an entp and hazel is probably infj , i see lots of ni from her . great book though ... sah sad :( i also think she's an enfp with a well developed tertiary te and that oswin was more entp . :) yeah i agree . i think he is probably intp or entp . i keep pulling towards entp because of tyrion in game of thrones ( lawl ) , but i can see intp too . it's so hard to tell between the two when you ... you know you're an entp when you send your friend 10 messages about different topics in under a minute and leave them not knowing how to reply . i love this movie so much ! yeah i agree with haunter , i think jack frost is probably more esfp than enfp because he uses more se than ne , but defs uses fi as the second function . i completely agree with enfp . he has heeps of ne and fi and uses te quite a lot too . i always thought he was either intp or infj ... it is so hard to tell . but now that people are suggesting intj i can see that too ... i think he is most likely one of those 3 though . i can see both ... i think most would agree that he has a dominant ne function , so enfp or entp . but i think he uses more ti / fe than fi / te , so i would say he's an entp . i think dan uses more ti than te . te = ...
