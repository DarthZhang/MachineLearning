' intp ? ? i don't know , i think he's hard to type . but since everybody's hard to type for me yet , i'm asking for your help :) it actually is . remember him saying in the end of the movie , that now he's finally understood that happiness can only be reached fully if shared ? that was pretty much the whole idea , at least for me i get extremely bored if someone i was interested in gets too obvious about being attracted to me . i think it might be because of my low self-esteem ? and it's especially bad if i could see that ... i'm sorry for not being there for my grandpa when he was dying you should've added the waltz for a night video too :) love the song . did you have a chance to talk to her ? het leven uit een dag - it's a dutch movie , and i think any infp ( especially the ones that adore foreign movies as much as i do ) will love it . it's very idealistic , has lots of beautiful , infp ... i really hope you do esfp . for sure ray - no idea harry - sj i think ken - i was thinking infj , could be wrong though chloe - uuum exfx ? ? ugh , i'm so bad at this ugh , stop crying omg i love justin bieber too ! you're so romantic you need to stop being so flirty you really should get your head out of the clouds sometimes hourglass , no idea about the measuremants though well i really hope you'll actually do that cause i've had a lotof that enough moments . and nothing really changed . but i honestly wish you'll do it ;) no actually i hate my infpness and would love to be any other type ( well ok , not estj maybe ) and i don't really huddle up here to talk about us infps all that much . wooah , it's like i'm looking in a mirror i'm becoming very pessimistic ( about my future in general ) , i'm sure it has to do something with the fact that i really don't like myself . i think i'm too young and foolish and i'm secretly afraid of ... i did some research on istp / estps and i'm pretty sure you guys are right . i'm thinking istp more than estp though why do all infjs have to be so supportive and great all the time ? : happy : thanks ;) i'm not so great at typing people yet , so i thought you'd do me a little favor here : tongue : so , i watched cruel intentions yesterday , one of my favourite childhood movies , and despite of thinking ... i don't think so . i can't speak for all infps out there , but i definitely can and do fake extroversion , sometimes to the point of being too persuasive at it . people think i'm naturally extroverted ... actually i was thinking about starting this thread too . i have that moments all the time . well .. my mom thinks we're close . my dad left us and even though we still keep in touch , we are anything but close . he's sort of a mystery for me , and our relationship is very , very messed up . long ... they say brandon flowers is isfp ? ? mm ? couldn't have expressed myself better : crazy : funny you mentioned dexter . i had that same thing while watching the series : wink : so yes , i can relate , and for a very long time ( before finding out about mbti ) i thought i was just being lame and ... movies : love me if you dare fight club midnight run into the wild the breakfast club .. yeah this list was very random , these are pretty much the only ones i could remember now music : heroin ... ha , actually i hit my face with a door yesterday and ended up with a swollen and hurt upper lip . : frustrating : it kind of reminded me of fight club : tongue : anyways yeah i'm very clumsy , i spill , i ... first two : blushed : i have kind of mixed feelings about being infp . i like the idea of being some kind of a rarity , besides i do like some of infp traits , but at the same times our flaws can be very damaging for ... i disagree . as infp , i'm sure it'll be amazing , and not only because of the physical pleasure , but because of this deep connection i'll have with my partner . i think that should be enough to ... i'm a virgin and plan on staying one til my marriage . absolutely . infp .  ... do i have to explain ? hahah :p roud : no , really , it seems that i'm always attracted to introverted , dark and troubled guys . actually , i prefer unhealthy infps : mellow : well , i answered no , and i'm pretty sure i'm not other man that is jealous of infp's real manliness . actually , there should've been third answer , like , i don't mind them , or i'd try having a ... yeah that feeling is really familiar . when you just want something to change , or just be in a better place , situation .. i'm optimistic about it , though . i think i'll achieve what i'm longing for , ... i like rolled up sleeves , too . looks great on both girls and guys : bored : i'm sort of a tomboy when it comes to fashion . i like wearing band t-shirts , t-shirts with cool sayings or pictures on them , polos , rarely cute tops . and i'm a huge jeans and sneakers fan : laughing : ... actually i'm really glad you started this thread , i've been thinking about this whole religion thing for a while . thing is , that growing up , i was always sure that god exists , that if i do something ... um let's see .. an artist , teacher , doctor , singer , actress , psychologist , photographer , psychologist again , and now i'm thinking about being a photographer again : confused : yeah .. really ? hood ? like robin hood ? oh that's so cool . i love it when people have interesting last names i always use random song names . i really like the killers , and they have this song - neon tiger . so yeah , i changed it a bit , made it kind of vegas-ish . oh , thanks : blushed : that erase / delete thing is a big problem though : mellow : indie singer . you know , travelling all around us and uk , playong your songs on a guitar in small pubs or bars or whatever . too bad i can't sing . or play . or write . : mellow : actually it's kinda ... there's nothing like hearing others say good stuff about you when you're infp : laughing : i got the same thing . 70 % introverts . i'm not really surprised : mellow : oh guys you have no idea how much i love all of you : blushed : mysterysolved , i really needed to find someone who has been there and here you are :P again , i love you guys :p roud : thanks , thanks so ... ugh , i gave up already . now the only thing i do about it is just let a long sigh when i see him ( not right into his face of course ! :p ) and try to distract myself . :p roud : really ? a few years ? you have no idea how much that meant : happy : ah , what a relief .. thanks ;) i've given that a thought , and came to a conclusion which is that i only act like that when feel like being you know , cheery and happy and stuff . usually it's right after i got something i really ... thanks , i really appreciate that you replied to the thread . means a lot . even though everything you said was true and it would be a smart thing to do to follow your instructions , i have to say that ...
