( except the buying books part ) . but really 95 % of what you wrote really represented ... yup all the time ! people get the im-contented-with-life vibes from me apparently or so ive been told . but its quite strange because i hurt so easily and become down quite often & get lost in those ... yes yes yes yes yes . haha i get along the best with infps . my best friend is an infp & i swear i've never felt as mch acceptance and connection with anyone else . my brother is an infp and we too get ... gosh , i could totally relate to this girl you're talking about . hmm what i think , though i may be mistaken , is that whenever someone new comes along ( in this case , you ) and i'm really into him and ... hmm , just had to reply to this ! i know this sounds corny but i strongly believe that if you have to change yourself just so that someone would notice you , then maybe that person isn't the right one ... just out of curiosity , so sts are less likely to get into relationships with people they're close to ? doesn't make much sense to me to be honest because don't you form a strong connection and bond ... sure :) errr .. for me i've never really ' had ' him in a sense but i hope it still counts ? hope this isn't too boring ! the one who got away would be my best friend .. whom i've known since i was 7 and in ... since i'm quite new here , thought i'd share a few things about myself :) i'm currently waiting to enter university / college ( cross my fingers that i get a place cos its really competitve in my country ... thank you for yr invaluable advice ! i needed someone to tell me that and i'll take your advice to heart . having such authority & all that you've described is something i've always envisioned in my ... hahaha so guility of this :) am slowly trying to stop this . hmm , i actually become uncommunicative mostly when ix92m upset or angry . but if someone upset others then i have no hesitation in ... haha omg i would be scared to death if i looked into the mirror and didnt see anything xd i think there was a movie made about this right ? some invisible guy who was the villain ? yes , i do wish i was invisble a lot of the time actually . especially when i'm being subjected to unwarranted attention or the spotlight's on me infront of people whom i'm not very familiar with and ... haha first time ranting here but i feel like im gonna explode if i don't . i'm not a very political person but when such injustice is glaringly obvious and right in my face , i get soo mad . my ... bigwilly yea , i mostly tend to avoid those im angry at too ( especially friends or those i care for ) instead of confronting the issue head on . and this usually takes a few days or weeks if it's really ... definitely . you sound like the complete opposite of me ! ( so i figure it has nothing to do with personality type like you mentioned ) . for me , no one takes me seriously because they believe i'm a ... exactly . haha are you sure you didn't read my mind ? ;) that's basically one of challenges i face - the split personality thing . i have to be strict to control them yet at the same time my first ... so it was my first day at work today as a part-time teacher and i had to teach this class of misbehaved 16 year olds who were really rebellious ( picture a class of 30 rebels put together ) . and other ... love telling puns & jokes like these ! loving this thread :) me : have you heard my butter joke ? dad : err .. no ? me : that's cos i haven't spread it . xd same here ! the closer i am to someone , the less guilty i feel in saying what i want directly . but it still occurs very very rarely . do you receive compliments well ? because for example , if i top the ... summersault aww you're sweet ! definitely experiencing that mind-blown feeling when someone puts into words what im thinking when i have difficulty expressing them . thanks a lot ! :) ( haha had to ... sorry im totally new at this ! how do you reply to someone with the ___ . is there a specific button ? help ! totally spot on ! ! i couldn't put it in better words :) sadly , i'm not very good with words ( english isn't my native lang ! ) . every thing you've said really applies to me as well ( except the intj ... 2w1 :) tho 6w5 in my tri-type ! thanks fr describing that :) yea , i could really relate to that ! if i wanted something for my birthday for example , i wont outright say i want ... instead , i'd maybe ask the person what he wants ... yeaa sounds very familiar :) i'd rather avoid a person than confront the issue . so sorry for the extremely late reply ! i've been so caught up with exams and all . firstly , thank you for replying to this thread :) and well , i've had enough time to think about it and yes , the lack ... because honestly , i dont think im that good . i sometimes cant articulate my thoughts very well and my speech becomes all jumbled up . its like i have all these feelings but its hard to put them into ... for me personally i find ti really attractive . maybe thats just me . because its something i lack ( 4th function ) and its really nice to have someone who's rational and can calm me down when im in one ... so far , my infp friends are really very feminine . as compared to my infj friends . i find that infps are gentler and more co-operative and go with the flow sort and just embodies being feminine ...
