not that there's anything wrong with it , but you may not be his type . no . no , man . i believe you'd get your ass kicked saying something like that , man . i watch way too much tv , love some good serialized drama . but i read a little bit of fantasy . hooked on brandon sanderson at the moment , with his mistborn series and his planned 10 - novel saga , ... that one annoys the hell out of me , too . nobody in their right mind really wants to know how i am , do they ?
