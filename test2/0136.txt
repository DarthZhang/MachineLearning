pay attention ! when you develop feelings for someone and you want to show it , but you feel like showing them you like them would be bugging them . and you would never want to bug someone with your emotions . so you ... wow . you sounds exactly like me five minutes ago . i dont know about you , but as for me i think my feelings of ' meh ' with the world stems from my disappointment with it . i know that any friends i make ... when a simple assignment from your professor becomes more complicated the more you think about it . no , i suppose not . i guess just some of us just have a little more catching up to do in the process of evolution than those like you who've reached that legendary enlightenment . meanwhile , we keep ... brilliant on every single point , especially these . my thoughts in a nutshell . thank you ! you just managed to explain what i had been trying ( and failing ) to do since the beginning :D hi ! op here . okay , so let me clarify because i think i confused some people . im not talking about friends you see occasionally , friends you just go do stuff with , or friends you dont think about ... its the legendary big topic of debate ! i know its probably been asked before , but do you honestly think that men and women can be close / best friends without there ever being a possibility of one ... fellow infjs , this question has been eating me up and tearing me apart at the same time . do any of you feel romantically unlovable ? i do . i feel like everyone that im ever interested in starts ... why yes , yes it is . its marked on my calendar ! : laughing : warning : first impressions last the longest in my mind . i am polar opposites with friends and big groups . you'd think i was an enfj with friends and an intj ( the kind that looks like theyre ... not a question . you guys are f * * * ing awsome thanks for the perspective . i never thought of any of that . i was convinced he hated and was avoiding me and i just wasnt getting the point . maybe not . i'll be the first to admit my ni can be ... i know this thread is old but ... ive got a question about isfps and conflict . so i have an isfp friend who i dont think particularly likes me all that much ? i mean at least , what he's doing is ... jaysh alysaria ok , so direct it is . might take me a few days to gain the courage though : unsure : i wouldnt want a one night stand . ive considered it , and while the thought in interesting , i'd never act on the desire . sex and love are so intertwined in my mind it'd go against my entire emotional ... oooh thats good ! and yes , quite taken ; to the point where i practically have to wear sunglasses to hide the little hearts in my eyes lol that makes pretty good sense now that you explain it , based on the way he was for years and how hes been the past 3 months . and maybe thatll be good too , to test the water first because id rather not ... thanks . i think i will tell him . at this point im almost willing to risk it . normally im extremely skittish about expressing feelings of this magnitude to anybody , but im tired of all the questions ... if you've had an enfp friend for years and suddenly he starts acting weird around you , and i mean like , being super quiet half the time and at a loss for words when he used to behave like a ( cute ) ... hi ! we seek knowledge of ourselves through understanding those around us . this a great place to start . welcome ! welcome to the infj community ! fellow infj with hsp here . hope to see you around ! when i make my friends take the test , i use this website personality test based on c . jung and i . briggs myers type theory screenshot your results , it will without fail come in handy later when ... yea , you sound like an entj lol . you should enjoy their forum though , its like being in the teacher's lounge back in school . very rarely do they let outsiders in hi ! ! ! welcome to the mbti army of perc ! always a pleasure to meet another infj , especially one who loves to write as much as i do . if you ever have questions about the forums and stuff , dont ... ive always felt like ive tried to fit in , but i know deep down i will never be able to really relate to anybody . i feel like an alien dressed in human skin . but im starting to come to grips with it ... i feel like i need to clap or go hug someone after reading this . thanks for sharing ! =D never heard of her , must look it up ! * crappy phone nexflix app makes her throw phone * . well i guess ill be looking this up at home haha whoops i replied to the wrong person on the last post . meant to reply to quid pro quo . i hit the wrong button . sorry ! in regard to your original post ( which i no longer see otherwise i would have quoted that one instead ) , i wasnt saying facts were irrelevant to me and that i only use fe to make decisions . i was ... thank you , that's exactly what i meant . thank you , that really did help me out a lot . so what you're saying is that you have them , you recognize them , but using them for things that dont necessarily call for an emotional response is just ... just thought i'd chime in here , since i had a question anyway that kind of relates to this . this is just my honest opinion . to answer your question from an outside perspective , its not what you ... been there too , but i usually get written off before they even get to know me which kinda sucks . its like they dont even give you a chance , like they dont even care enough to pretend to try . maybe ... haha thats actually one of my favorite songs interesting . i see what you mean , like its an abstract way to fool our minds into continuing mankind i used to be a really happy person all the time , satisfied with knowing what people need and making them happy . i guess i got left and and rejected ten too many times . you know how the infj already ... true true . theres always something interesting going on with you guys . maybe i like that because i absolutely dread boring people . theres nothing for me to try to understand and figure out with ... yep , especially those intuitives who use their intuition for stupid things , or completely attach thoughts and ideas together wrong . i actually wish those people werent intuitive at all ... i'm really not much of a gamer at all , but do i still get kudos if i name the decade ?
