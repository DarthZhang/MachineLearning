thanks , i was feeling a bit confused . i know right ? ! i saw it on someone else's signature and i actually tried to swat it away xd for the first thing about possibilities , definitely . i ask myself that all the time . about the second , i'd rather do something useful that something that wont even be finished . up until a couple months ago , i thought i was an estj . then someone told be that it's unusual for estjs to be on forums , and i love forums . but the thing that really made me wonder if i was entj was ... if you do something for the good of society , if affects you too because you are part of society . if half the country were about to die , you would help them not just for moral reasons , but for the ... yes . if you didn't kill the single innocent person , hundreds more innocent people would die . if you didn't kill the single person , you'd essentially be indirectly killing hundreds of other innocent ... if you constantly feel the need to control others , you might be an entj . guilty . tell me why , if there is a god , why wouldn't he help all the homeless and starving people ? why would he let disasters like hurricane katrina , the japan earthquake , and the joplin tornado happen ? ... you might be an entj if you desperately feel the need to control people who do things wrong . yeah , entjs are scarce . it's kinda sad . i usually wear jeans and a t-shirt . but if i had lots of money and you were asking me what would i wear if i could shop anywhere , i would probably be wearing clothing from this website - mod retro ... i , i'll get by i , i'll survive when the world's crashing down when i fall and hit the ground i will turn myself around don't you try and stop me i , i won't cry - alice by avril lavigne p's annoy me so much because they are usually very unorganized . organization is a big thing for me . and organization is a j thing . especially with my esfp sister , i always found myself yelling at her ... isfj - 6 years enfp - 2 or 3 years istp - 2 years infp - 9 years hufflepuff o : my dad is o + and he's an istj ! ! ! thanks that sounds really cool ! :D i will seriously consider it . favorite - science ( except for chemistry ! ) hate it - math and american history i love , love , love , science , except for chemistry . i love science so much because it is using factual and concrete ... i slammed doors many times when i was little too . it just kind of releases the anger you have . but also yes , the hugs and kisses thing is definitely about fairness . but what my mom used to do with me ... i'm doing an independent study project for school and i'm still looking for a topic , so i would greatly appreciate it if i could have some ideas for topics i could study . i want to study something ... in no certain order : 1 . go with her plan 2 . if she asks you what looks good , tell the truth . 3 . make sure there's nothing out of place . as i've been reading all these posts , i think i speak for most estjs when i say i want something useful . not some little trinket that will gather dust day after day , but an item that i will actually ... badminton ! bet you haven't heard that one yet , huh ?
