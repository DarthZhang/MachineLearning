' ramones - shock treatment * describes this moody intp , other intps you meet may or may not act moody . this is a trick question , is it ? scaring old ladies at the bus stop isn't making friends . i walk with my hands in my pockets , and in this windy weather , face down . yes . drink both and get back to us first thing in the morning . books and cats . in that order . re . discussion though : i loathe small talk to hell and back , but unless i'm in the right mood ( which is .. rare ) , i also hate debates and discussions . perhaps not inferior , but let's call them challenging ( feelers , anyone ? ) not at all , until some fool is dumb enough to actually give me power to abuse . oh , that didn't come out well . i mean : no , i never , ever would . in a million years ! not yet , but lately i've ( against my will ) turned into a more in contact with your emotions type , so i could as well give it a try . ( and then realise it was a horrible idea , and be cured for life ... * deep breath * oxidativecleavage , i think i'm in love with you . ( damn , that took long to type after drinking too much beer . ) i often think i've showed people how pleased i am with the presents , and it turns out i've screamed with joy inside my head , and people still haven't figured out i can be very happy even if my face ... i'm a bit drunk right now , and typing without typos is a real pain in the arse all of a sudden . yes , i do . as a child , i used to spend hours daydreaming about going back in time to see what it ... merry christmas , all . the family stuff is over , so i'm finally all alone with my beer . see ? you had the answer all along . romantic in the traditional sense ? no . in any other sense ? i'm not sure . in this day and age though , when a girl decides to wear skirts every day , she must be a sweet , hopeless romantic . the next one ... beer helps , which is probably why i rarely drink . if i'm at home the entire day , i don't always bother to shower , but i'll take a quick shower if i need to get something from the shop . i don't really exercise , unless walking counts . i often walk ... stuff like that would make me wish death upon the offender . a painful death . for once , i don't have a single thing to complain about , i'm sitting here with my vegan cocoa and looking forward to a ... i don't quite know what to do with myself when people around me start crying . i usually try my best to carry on with the conversation like there's no one sobbing their little heart out right next to ... as long as it's sincere , i'm generally happy with compliments . a few things i'd like to hear though : you're right / you were right all along i bought you some chocolate wanna share a bottle ... i hate crying because it makes me feel weak and vulnerable . and if i first start crying , i can't seem to stop until my whole body is aching . i listen to a lot of different stuff , but my only real favourite is ramones . as a child i never had an urge to get close to insects or spiders at all , let alone torture them . i have a very irrational fear of spiders though , and if i see one inside , it has to die . i'm a vegan , mostly for ethical reasons . apart from the obvious peace and quiet , i always appreciate money . this year i also want vegan cookbooks , but as usual , i expect people to ignore my wishlist and instead buy stuff they think i need . left-handed . although i still think my existence would be greatly improved by abilities such as stealth and being able to fly , i don't care much these days . most of the time being just me is fine , until my ... you're very welcome . now can i have my free cookie ? i'm not ambitious when it comes to career , power and money . the thing i care about is animal's rights , and heaven knows that won't make you rich . physical pain makes me cry , i have a toothache from hell at the moment and i think i've cried more this week than i have for years . i know you love me too . want a hug ? ask her what she wants to do . radical idea , i know . if i had a boyfriend , a perfect date would be either alcohol and computer games , or alcohol and star wars . let's sit down and talk about our feelings . you know i love you guys . understand , most of the time . on the rare occasion i want to change the world , i quickly realise people are stupid and aren't going to change , so i go back to observing . 28 , i always thought i'd feel ( and act ) like a grown up by now . i still get asked for id when i buy cigarettes or beer though , which is kinda nice when you're not young anymore . congratulations ! intolerance , closed mindedness , ultimatums , being pinned down , emotional blackmail , people who are always optimistic .. i could go on and on , it's a long list . i get very lonely sometimes . i have acquaintances , but no friends because i always keep people at a distance . i want to get married some day , but i don't want sex . i wish i had the ability to ... i've tried to like routine , atleast enough to keep the flat tidy and do the washing up every day , but it's so mindnumbingly boring ! welcome , leave your f at the door and hand over the chocolate . oh hell yes ! i can't stop analysing and overanalysing what i said , my bodylanguage , what i didn't say , how i phrased things , how i should have phrased things .. you sure are a good looking bunch ! for repetitive stuff , i need music as a background noise to stay sane . if i need to really concentrate on something , i find a song to match my current mood and play it over and over . i sing to my cat , never to myself or other people . we should have more of these late night emotional conversations . i wish i could be like you , you always have something nice to say to people you meet . do you have to be so bubbly and cheerful ... a very short list of the books i've read and liked : the hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy don quixote ( in my humble opinion , it's the best novel of all times ) one day in the life of ivan ... i'm all for equality and all that jazz , but i don't think women belong in the men's locker room at all . i'm not saying she was asking to be harassed , of course not , but i think there's been a bit ... yea , i sometimes get the rather irrational fear that other people can take one look at me and know exactly what i'm thinking , which makes me try really hard not to think about anything at all , which ... with computers and internet , i'd probably not even notice i was being held in a cage . one of my worst nightmares . both teachers and my parents tried to nudge me in the right direction , to no avail . i've had a few discussions that went along these lines : - you're not very tidy , ...
