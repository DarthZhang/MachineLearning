' i think he's just looking for affirmation because he likes someone and doesn't know if he's gay or he likes the type and wonders if there are any homosexuals . there's also the possibility that he's ... i'd say let them be and don't try to initiate something . especially if it involves any kind of manipulation - it'd only make it worse . i get along with stjs at an okay level outside of my family , but ... no . just no . unless you have a shovel and a body bag handy for one of those nights which are to come ... no , i can't remember having identity issues ... i can't properly describe who i am , but i have a feeling for who i am anyway . i have a personality and i'm expressing it to its fullest . when i was ... what ? why does it matter who's the first ? are you sure you're his first ? how old is he ? because right now it seems like he wants a relationship with you but he hasn't been in any , and entjs tend to ... being direct is the best way to talk to an entj . personally i hate indirect , it's annoying and it's a waste of time . you could just get over your need to be indirect and be direct for once - it'll ... ... if people see you as intimidating and you don't understand why . i love the idea of a debate ( for the reasons mentioned by and others ) , however some people just purely piss me off . most notably sfjs as they seemingly don't believe in facts . intps ... i bet his claws are deep in his skin . : cool : they can be interesting until you talk for longer than 10 minutes . that's when it hits you - this conversation has been pointless for the last minute and it's not gonna change . the only solution is ... no . not at all . i used to be a bit shy when talking to a girl , but i'm not anymore . that's rare . i can't remember the last time i had full-on tears . something that made my eyes water up ... a couple of movies and maybe a song or two under certain circumstances . news - never . someone ... lol , quite a thread past the first page . as for the first page ... i generally get annoyed by entps and they generally get annoyed by me . basically because they're trying to piss me off because ... no . already done most of the things on the list , didn't work . i feel like i want something tangible and real , not something that i can read or hear . i've had too much of that prior to feeling this way ... they do not nor do they think i hate theirs . and yes , they are isfps , i'm sure of that . one of them actually shares something from time to time but to me it looks so on-the-surface that it doesn't ... i was speaking with an isfp yesterday and he was going on about me doing so many great little things and i thought to myself : so what ? they don't matter . they didn't last long , nobody remembers ... i've known one isfp for months now - same situation . another one for years - same situation . another i've known for probably months - same situation . should i go on ? unless the shell is decade-thick , ... you sound almost exactly like me - that happens to me from time to time ( couch thoughts ) and i also ( for quite a while now ) don't have much control over my future . it felt like reading something i ... definitely agreed about intps . finally ! as for isfps ... they seem kinda dull to me , most of the time . rarely can i have an entertaining conversation with one . it becomes boring rather quickly ... well , maybe not as much giving up as losing the excitement or something close to that ... it's hard to explain , really . it's quite ironic with isxjs actually - they complain about it yet they say ... my whole life i haven't expressed my annoyance in short-term situations ( waiting at the counter for example ) , as it changes nothing . nor am i impatient most of the time in such situations , as i can't ... who the hell raw eats tomatoes + butter ? wtf ? ! : laughing : i have a friend like that . she has the attention span of a cat . she's easily distracted by anything and everything . makes me crazy . [ / quote ] oh hell , i hate people like that . i don't ... i'm gonna provide you with a sharp weapon if you're coming here to take care of people like that . joking part - yes ! sometimes people even see my behavior as condescending because they don't get that i'm joking and just having fun . i sense sarcasm . people do seem to think that entjs are not very expressive , or aren't expressive at all . i've actually heard people telling me that , and today i've read it in another thread . i ... why do people complain that they're tired every single day ? who cares ? if you've been tired for the past 12 months because your job's hard , cool , doesn't mean you gotta cry about it every single day ! ... sure . sometimes . if you can call all of this spontaneous . some of these things sound like something i'd do to just solve it , instead of putting it off . her fe is a vampire ! i actually said that today ! she is awkwardly faking the smile . how are you two getting along ? 15 years is a looong time ! you look tired . when you talk . gestures , face , tone of voice . are you ? awww , thanks for vouching for me , haha ! ah , you don't wanna hog ' em all just for yourself , eh ? hehe . messaged more people , let me know if anyone else is interested ! sarahbrave - indeed , thank you for your answer , it was a great read for my evening . belligerent - hostile , isn't that what it means ? i never come off as hostile . people tell me i come off as nice , yet aggressive . i don't think i'm aggressive , but i do get told that my general demeanor is aggressive . the way i express myself . i don't know why . personally , i see some intps much more aggressive than me . they ... you sound a bit like an entj , kazoz . at least like me anyway . enfps seem very warm and easy to talk to , they seem genuinely interested in what you have to say and they do like one-on-one ... just bumping , in case someone missed the post , since only one person expressed actual interest in a pm . not an intp , but i do find enfps really cool . at least with the little exposure i had to them , compared to most other types . especially in real life . the cool part is that they're always talking , ... what would make you happy , when you're in that mood ? or maybe to not get into that mood in the first place ? you sound almost as sad as an infp ! hehe . well what else am i supposed to say , i wanna talk to enfps . my mind is incapable of working on another efficient and rational solution ! : shocked : sure ! i would like to get to know more enfps in a more personal manner than forum posts , so if any of you are up for a voice conversation , let me know ! i'm not up for recordings of any sort , i'm interested ... sounds like you choose people you get clingy for really carefully , but you do get clingy about the ones you actually form the bond with . i hope i'm not off here . infps seem to be from what i've read and noticed . are you clingy ? do you get very attacked to someone ? for example , i know 2 infps who are unable to get over their exes for a long time now . weirdly enough , people tell me that too . kazoz i'm not really surprised , enfps are more people-oriented . self-explanatory - what would you have to be doing to feel like you're enjoy every moment of every day ? i don't necessarily mean long-term . i bet it'd be traveling , being on-the-move , meeting lots of ... 102 . thou shalt express your ideas with your actions , regardless of what others may think of you . nighty 88 goals don't necessarily have to be people-oriented . that sounded like p / j play . content is not good / enjoyable .
