' i have the same argument with my intp boyfriend all the time . he's introduced me to friends and family , but he refuses to bring me around his new co-workers . he says he doesn't like to mix worlds ... thanks everyone ! a lot of you later posters really hit the nail on the head . he really is a wonderful man who , not only tolerates my daughter , but totally adores her . if i wasn't so nervous and ... yes , totally ! he said it really made him feel better just knowing that i understood why he'd been feeling steamrolled . he says it's true he fears my need to jump to closure when i am stressed , but ... ok , i just talked to him , and we worked this all out . there's a lot of back story . basically though , i didn't include him at all in the apartment hunting processes , and that's really what bothered ... yes ! this is exactly what i am afraid of . i have been involved with a man like that before , and it was horrible . i am afraid i'm just about to get into the same thing here . i mean , if this is a good ... well , i was thinking you could relate , as an intp , to a time when you felt angry at a certain external family situation ( a move , for example ) and didn't know how to deal with your close loved ones ... hi everyone , i posted here a lot last year about my best friend , a confusing intp . now i'm dating a seemingly awesome intp . very smart , funny , and usually very caring , protective and complimentary ... hah ! yes , that is so him . he always wants a blueprint to my inner , emotional life . and i actually suck at talking about emotional things and my own needs . so that is already a big communication gap ... i'm really close to intj ( like 1 % feeling ) , and i think i can relate to him . i did the same ignoring thing to my first boyfriend ( an intp ) for about six months before we finally started dating . i ... the sex thing was a joke , everyone ! yeah , exactly . he feels it's like , i'm your boyfriend . of course i'll be there for you . but i don't mean it to imply that . i profusely thank my enfp friend for being there precisely because she is ... i said besides sex , people ! ;) and i'm not saying i have sex specifically to make someone feel appreciated . i just find it can have that effect . hi everyone ! so i'm now dating this really nice guy . i've been going through a difficult time , and he's been incredibly supportive ( always there to listen , taking me out to dinner to get my mind ... yes , he confessed further yesterday to feeling nervous and blatantly said , if i ever do something that bothers you , please just tell me . don't let it fester . i just tell him , don't worry . i ... hi everyone , i've noticed with the guy i'm currently dating ( and my intp exboyfriend as well ) , that , although neither is blatantly clingly , they give off a certain eager to please / nervous ... all the enfps i know are actually really good at math and science , so they must be good with logical thinking . i think they just rarely apply that logic to social interactions with people . or ... he doesn't sound like an intp as much as he sounds absolutely insane . how old is he ? could he be having some kind of psychotic break ? thanks , gang ! our next hurdle : talking on the phone ! we're supposed to talk tonight . i am so nervous ! i really need to just calm down . . . any words of advice ? it's funny to me how he is totally ... they were all works of literature with a little theory mixed in . he majored in english lit . i read the isfp description . i see a bit of that in him . he is certainly very hard on himself and ... more data ! ( and a question at the end :) 1 . he has an absolutely beautiful apartment . it is filled with books , but everything is very orderly and aesthetically pleasing , even artistic . he also ... as a follow up question : a lot of you have mentioned his probable anxiety about screwing things up . is there anything xntps find especially soothing for that type of relationship anxiety ? ... i actually hope you're right ! i think , for long term relationships , i tend to be more attracted to i types . we understand each other's need for quiet time to recharge ha ! thanks guys . well , i'm pretty positive about the ntp part because he claims he loves to argue and that anyone who gets offended by me probably isn't anyone i want to be friends with anyway ... i'm not good at expressing my affection for people in words . they never sound genuine to me . and also , as a woman , i like the guy to lead the way ( and then i'll meet him if i feel the same ) . i ... i posted this in the entp forum as well because i can't figure out which this guy is . a bunch of them suggested he sounds like an intp . i'm not sure because i've only ever known 1 intp . so ... thanks , everyone ! yeah , i'm pretty sure about the ntp part because of the infrequent communication and not verifying details until the last minute . also , he describes himself as loving to argue , ... which of the behaviors make you think so ? do you identify with any of those things ? it's also possible i'm just misinterpreting them and have drawn the wrong conclusions . ( like , maybe he wasn't so ... so i've been out with this guy a few times , and i think he's an entp . i don't know him well enough to interpret his behaviors yet , but i've made some inferences so far . ( sometimes i just get ... thanks guys ! you were right . a simple text cleared everything up . all is well :) yeah , given he was the one who asked me out again , i don't think it's a matter of being low on the priority list . also , he didn't literally say check one thing he actually had to check specifically ... hi entps ! question : i had a date last weekend with an entp . he emailed me the next day to schedule a second date . he asked me when i was free . i told him . he said , i just have to double check ... ok , so what exactly would you say ? like , thanks again for dinner . i had a nice time . ? hi entps , last night , i had a nice date with a guy i met on an internet dating site . i'm pretty sure he's an entp . i know for sure he enjoyed himself . he paid for everything . he made a point of ... [ quote = tendency ; 1662854 ] man , i've used sites on and off for years . i'm surprised that this person has enough responses to get practice dates . > yeah , that's what surprised me as well . when i ... ha ! well said . but here's my defense in this case : he used to be the sweetest , gentlest , smallest , quietest boy in our grade . it wasn't until he went off to college that he became such an asshole . i ... ha - you sound exactly like me ! ( i see you are an intj ) . that's my whole issue . i'm not attracted to someone based on pictures and what they say about themselves . i need to really know their mind ... yeah , it's kind of surprised me how well my intp friend took to this online dating thing , actually . to me , it seems a bit awkward . but i do have friends that have found success that way . they are ... it's true what the others have said about the intp loyalty to those they respect . i've basically blurted out more awkward , emotional , clingy things than i can count to my intp exboyfriend ( now ... how are you guys when it comes to online dating ? ( like using dating sites ) . i'm new to the field and just curious . my intp friend finds someone he really likes , exchanges several emails , then asks ... when i was in a relationship with an intp , i had no idea when he was going to say i love you or if he did in fact love me until after about 8 months . we were long distance then , and he came to ... exactly ! i'm trying to keep my flexibility / kindness but also gain some assertiveness and a sense that i matter too . yeah , i know my submissiveness actually freaks him out . i mean , he's known me long enough that he's not going to be suspicious of me per se . and he obviously likes that i'm flexible and accomodating ... as an intj / infj , assertiveness is something with which i struggle . i'm trying to become more aware of my own needs and voice them in relationships . anyway , i'm just wondering how you guys tend ... i'm pretty sure he's not an intp ( he works with machinery as a technician / sales person ) but i really have no clue . . . can intps work with machines ? i just know he's smart and has a sarcastic , ... hey guys , i have this other friend , and i'm trying to figure out his type . i don't know him very well . what are the key factors you guys tend to look for in trying to figure out someone's type ? ... i just want to say my intp friend does that sleeping thing all the time . his preferred mode of dealing with emotions is curling up in his bed and napping ( for as long as necessary ) , and he is also ... wow ! that really hits the nail on the head . and i think , when he is still in the infatuation stage with a girl , he's willing to violate his own boundaries and do whatever it takes just to be with ... ha - i say go for it ! provided she's a decent person , if you feel emotionally and physically stirred by someone to the extent that you need to build in boundaries , i think it's a sign you have a ... ha-yeah , it's literally curb your enthusiasm . i think that p function in him is just too unpredictable . he says some girls make him feel like he's under a spell while he's with them . he thinks ... oh - i already agree with you . he's been open about his feelings ( still has feelings . still attracted . just adamantly opposed to dating again ) . that's why i said i could see myself dating him , but i ...
