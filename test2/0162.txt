' i hope this will be the last post . the thread before this started as a result of me and my friends joking about confessions and one of the methods that were thought about were anonymous love letters ... in my opinion , i think that people who are nice and people who are just pretending to be nice show subtle differences in how they act . sometimes , people can be suspiciously nice , willing to do ... mass fungal growth is op . what are you talking about ? there is no point in my post . i was watching starcraft and just wanted to express my support for strelock ! pro-tip : earn a masters degree with a major in trolling and a minor in statistics . the whole time this thread was going on , i was watching starcraft replays . my god , i told people that it was completely irrelevant and i had no plans of doing so anyway . i was 15 seconds from doing it today ya know ? but wow , you are pretty smart , seeing through 70 % of my troll shields and identifying even intensities . good job ; even my friends couldn't do that . this thread is probably reaching the point where it will become volatile . i really don't know how to say this any better ; i really never was going to write a letter . from the start , there has only been the direct path and i've known that . the reason i posted the threads ... why do you all assume that i would do such a thing ! ? i'm a genius , i knew it all from the start . i was never going to do that . i didn't lie ; me and my friends just got into a debate about it . that would probably not work ! doing such a thing will cause the sender to roil with revulsion and realize that the person doing this is insane and does not deserve kindness ! ^ _ ^ this person has intelligence well , i'm 15 ;) and a certified genius ;D intj's on the forum misinterpret what they see as they are vastly cynical and do not realize the truth of the matters and instead assume . i love them for it . what you should know is that i actually enjoy those forums ;) still , my previous post applies and what else can you guess ? i must say , you are brighter than the rest mei . man i love this place ! contrary to popular belief , i'm having fun posting on this thread . sound like you haven't seen what's really been going on in this thread . my god , i am trolling . please understand that this is serious business . there is no inter-forum war . all you need to know is that i am a genius troll :D o ^ o a person actually answered the question ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ! ? ! ? i must be high . probably something to do with a femanon and telling them to gtfo . that's usually why troll threads last so long . lol wut ? looks like you need another roll at the d20 my god , it's sarcasm . i don't think you understand . i confessed to the girl i liked a long time ago . you don't seem to understand that there is no real life situation . yes , i shouldn't . but what he just said violates every strand in my body . i can't not tell him to f * * * off anymore . i hate being accused of things i'm not . not when they start accusing you of erroneous statements . you know , i really didn't want to say anything but god damn , you piss me off . i am not asking you for advice on wiggling my way into some girl's heart and to be honest , you're a dick for accusing me ... no , they just seem so full of themselves ( although that's mostly cause this is the internet ) . it'll piss you off if you have not mastered at least one year in the art of trolling . talking . take one card . i must have faith in a supernatural being to be able to withstand that place ... need new plan ... i'd rather be at 4chan :D the predominant thought in my mind right now is , get over yourselves . ( sarcasm ) it's too hard to teach you all feelings ( sarcasm ) but i still have hope . cool story bro . anyway , is it so bad to promote understanding ? i knew your responses from the start , yet i still held hope that you all would provide multiple points of views and hopefully get ... me 2 . glad we agree . on an unrelated note , go sterlock ! this made me lol . i don't have a crisis . you can assume what you would like ; it's your mind . but regardless of what you think of the op ( who is allegedly a faggot as urban dictionary says ) , do as you ... i agree ; i am a master of confusion . especially against myself . ? wth is this about ? jesus christ , read your own profile picture . honestly , i'm not going to insult you no matter how much you try to piss me off so please don't insult me for playing with you . i'm not trolling you all . you all have such pessimistic / emotionless outlooks on the world . it is incredibly interesting to be honest . interesting ... go on , i want to hear more . would you even let them get it out ? would you avoid them to the point that you don't even acknoledge them as a person ? if you did let them finish , would ... woah , that's harsh but thanks for posting . i would like to know what would go on in your head if a person who annoys you ( not on purpose ) confesses to you and to think from the opposite point of view as well . here are two interesting questions that i have been wondering about : let's say that you hate someone of the opposite sex ( or same sex if you swing the other way ) but you don't actually outright say ... i agree . if someone like me were to do it , i would make it a game . these are some interesting replies . many of the other other personality types respond differently and less negatively . if you are wondering why this topic was posted by me , it's because recently a ... idk if i would consider many people out there ' nice guys ' . to me , there has never been a ' nice guy ' . most of the time , i can be nice and frequently end up doing something with the incentive for money ... to whom are you suggesting and how is that relevant ? what would you think if you got a anonymous love letter that confessed about the person liking all of your good qualities ? would you rather have had them burned it or be more formal ( or , ...
