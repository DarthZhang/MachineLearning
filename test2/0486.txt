' i'm almost positive that si comes from the word sigh i thought you were a bird , my apologies . do you prefer red wine or white wine ? right , don't you worry . i'm going to befriend you and then pluck you . you won't see it coming : kitteh : do you have a horse ? so this was you two ? ? ? watch out , i'm coming for you and your families hahaha who says i'm supporting him ? : tongue : you believe it should be left to movies and tv series but perhaps he doesn't , that's all i'm saying . he could be trolling his way into the white house , ... well being a president is not a joke but running for president can be turn into one . if you follow what i'm saying , once he is president , he will probably be much more serious . if he is being a joke ... i meant that i can spend more time here because i'm taking some exams at the moment , therefore i spend more time at home alone , studying and i spend some of my breaks on perc . then i didn't want you ... you know we are in entp land when no one answered the questions asked by the op : tongue : hum have you considered ( as entp i'll assume you have ) that trump's stupidity may be his tv persona and that he may not be the moron he appears to be on tv ? i'm not saying he's actually smart i'm ... that or they are assholes :p roud : not an infp but i lost the password of my perc account so i thought why not start a new account with a clean slate ? of course i didn't need a clean slate at all haha . hence i chose the username ... any of you watched the tv show chuck ? love this show . what are your thought on the show ( apart from typing ) ? and of course , what do you think regarding the types of the characters ? :) oh alright haha so you based your typing of him on a trailer ? that was funny haha i didn't even know about the guess my type lol i will . and you should watch it , it's funny and overall pretty good ;) i thought ti would help him put a personal method together . it's not just improvising , it's finding solutions to the problems he is confronted with . have you watched the show completely ? what do you ... i think ne is definitely one of his top two functions . i pegged him as infp at first but he seems more fe than fi and he uses ti . could be esfj but the way he can improvise solutions on the spot ... se can read people too , if we go by functions i was just making a joke about your answer and the topic , i didn't mind your answer at all . this is a cool story by the way obviously you didn't get to choose since you don't have free will . silly of me to ask ;) for those of you who haven't watched chuck yet , i recommend , it's pretty funny oh yeah i understand your point what systems are you referring to ? interesting that you changed your career , may i ask why ? i'm gonna enter a business school , hopefully . knowledge in psychology might be of help in that line of study ;) 3 . not good and not bad either . i don't know really . i like to think that i'm an ... i integrated the knowledge into my world view while being exposed to new concepts in an academic environment i laughed haha that's a nice way to put it indeed do you hold a science-related job ?

i finished the show a couple of days ago and i loved it . i'm wondering if chuck isn't an entp ? he obviously is a ne type , wonder which one though . any thoughts on that ? i understand better now . the rain drop will fall on a location based on variables outside of the rain drop itself , hence the rain drop obviously doesn't choose where it lands . human beings are ... i wanted to engage in a conversation with you but since you proposed , i'm going to read the thread , at least a little , to gain more insight about the topic and then i will get back to you the ne-si in that example lol . so you're saying that the only reason i choose to eat the apple is because nothing ( no thought about the apple being filled with a worm or no sight of a worm for ... right now , sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones i didn't read the thread yet , but if you consider free will to be the ability to consciously make a decision and if free will doesn't exist then when do our decisions come from ? just wondering ... hi everyone basic questions : 1 ) age or age range ? i'm 19 2 ) city , country and / or region ? i'm french i live in paris . lol i read religion instead of region haha . my parents are christians 3 ) ... the second one was actually much longer but i deleted it because i realized what i said wasn't very nice . anyway , never thought of that haha that's a very cool idea , i will do that . also , since the ... you're right , it lacks physical communication . i'm gonna think about what i will do haha thank you wow you are totally right . now i feel bad :( well apart from those kinds of gathering , i don't see her that often , mostly we speak through texts . we text a lot so she spends some of her own time ... anyone ?

it seems like a very promising friendship . i ... the way you described his tolerance , you could have very much been talking about me because i am very tolerant as well . many people have told me that they were comfortable and could be themselves ... i know two esfps . one is my sister and one is a male friend of mine so i cannot really talk about romantic relationships with esfp haha . esfp are nice , however they usually appears to be self ... in theory intuitive types all seem smarter , more mysterious , more insightful etc .. than sensors , causing a lot of smart and insightful sensors to test and identify better with n types than with s ... i have an istj friend , she is nice and cute but so close minded . sometimes i feel like everything outside her opinion doesn't exist in her eyes .. / hi my intj friends , i come to you for advice and insight : happy : i'm friend with an intj and i'm going to describe her . i'd say she ressembles the intj descriptions pretty well . she is very very ... in my opinion your friend is a fi-type , from what i gathered . she probably is an esfp since you thought she was an estp . several things in your post make me think of that : - she does not let go , ... someone once told me that i was artistic in the way i live . this person also told me that i somehow inspired him which really made me emotional haha i'm comfortable with sadness . i'd rather be sad than feeling nothing , although the sadness i sometimes feel is usually intense and short lived . i don't like prolonged sadness the only feeling i ... i think i needed to hear that right now , thank you lol i don't like 007 that much . what made me want to be a spy was the fictional stories of alex rider who was a teenage spy i read as a kid that was juste a phase though '
