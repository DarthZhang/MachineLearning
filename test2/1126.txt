i'm really thinking right now that the only way out of an existential crisis is to literally forget about it ... however , i feel like denying connections to others is merely struggling against human nature . humans are inherently social beings and last i checked , i'm still a human , so i disagree . thanks ... i know exactly what you're talking about . i think people easily dismissing typical intj problems could be because they're weighty problems for us , but to other people , it seems like something we just ... so i'm dealing with an existential crisis again , as is par for the course when i don't have any immediate obligations or deadlines and i'm just sitting at home by myself . i've always loved the ... when i have a crush on someone , i basically try to become a really good friend . i'll always listen to her . i'll help her out whenever she needs help . i'll encourage her . i'll try to hang out with her ... i had a few classes in 11th and 12th grade with an esfp ( i'm pretty sure she's an esfp ) . she's not the smartest , but boy was she committed . she blurted out some hilariously wrong answers in ... . yeah you might be right , but it would be such a shame though . thanks for your input :) i think it's been a slow burn , with annoyances piling up over time ( e . g . being oversensitive , inadvertantly rude sometimes , etc . ) , but then again , i only really got to know eva and lily well about a ... i really love you can't fix something you didn't break . it's so true . i'll have to remember that one . i'll try the objective criticism . maybe that'll work . side note : our choir is going on ... wait is this an elaborate joke about how all intjs are robots ? :P in all seriousness , i like most of the classic stuff . heaviest i go is slayer i think . screaming isn't really my thing to be ... i used to get mad all the time when i was a kid . like screaming mad . i'd get normal mad at lots of things , but only screaming mad at my brother , who still to this day loves to make me mad . ... whoa that fourth paragraph is really interesting . i never really thought about it , but it makes so much sense . just now , i was talking to michelle about a fairly good friend of hers , who i know as ... i'm sorry for what happened with your friends . yeah they're seniors , so you're right about the high school . i like your advice though . i was already considering something along those lines , but i ... that title sounds a bit dramatic , i suppose , but that's sort of what this is all about . so , i have three female friends ( 17yo ) , an infp , let's call her michelle , another infp , eva , and an enfp , ... hi , enfps . i'm writing a story , in which the character drama revolves around an intj and an enfp , after getting along , clashing , because they're both putting up a front , a metaphorical mask . by ... hi , intjs . i'm writing a story , in which the character drama revolves around an intj and an enfp , after getting along , clashing , because they're both putting up a front , a metaphorical mask . by ... hi echoanne ! :) 1 : it's possible that he views you differently now that he knows you're an enfp , but i don't really get that vibe here . 2 : unless he's a jerk and i don't think he is , he's not ... don't worry about it , man . ;) ( also : hehe long face :P ) i forgot that that expression doesn't exist in english , whoops . :P it just means you cast your proverbial line to two romantic interests to see which one will bite . and here we see the magic of ... thanks . :) i was of course , because they're girls , almost instantly accused of ' betting on two horses ' , but it was to be expected . i get those kinds of prejudices a lot , because i don't really fit ... i'm doing pretty good . i was able to make two of my friends happy on valentine's day , so i'm feeling pretty great right now . :) * stumbles into the room * oh hey guys , what's up ? :) hi all . i've made a few ' friends ' here on perc , but i'm finding it hard to keep talking to them . i have this natural instinct to not want to bother anyone , even when i really want to talk to them ... not even / definitely perc isn't free of gender and type stereotyping . stereotyping , albeit to a certain level , has to be expected and there is no point fighting it . to be honest , i tend to ... i'd thank you again , but i'm afraid we'd get stuck in a thankfulness loop :P i guess this is a great example of the reason why intjs and enfps get along so well . they brighten up eachothers days ... i'm consistently amazed by your ( and enfps in general ) ability to make me swoon . one of my favourite things about enfps . you made my day . thanks :) let me tell you . there are things in this world that i like , like ice cream . there are things in this world that i like a lot , like ' avatar : the last airbender ' and deep , intelligent discussion . ... it's natural for our society to prefer respect is earned , but i prefer my respect can be lost . i respect everyone ( nuance : to a certain extent ) , because i'm not an egomaniac who only finds some ... i get that a lot . intjs tend to only say something when they really have something to say and they usually talk pretty calmly under normal circumstances . universialism is something very ... tridentus pzs , sorry for not getting back to you sooner , but i've been really busy lately . thank you for your responses though . they're really interesting . :) ok , so i have some more general ... hi pinky ! :) from my experience of having a crush on someone for about three years now , you will emotionally wreck yourself if you stay so invested in the possibility of a relationship with him . i ... there was a thread on this a while ago and i found this answer by kiproco ( http://personalitycafe.com/enfp-forum-inspirers/68038-what-does-unhealthy-enfp-look-like.html ) quite interesting . hi everyone ! i'm in the planning stages of writing a story ( yes still :P ) and i need your advice . the story will start with each one of the characters discovering what they want in life and ... i like misslady 333 ' s nuance , because it does differentiate between people who find it weird that other people like them , and people who are , in a way , a bit depressed . i count myself among the ... the title reminded me of a tweet by yoko ono : imagine the eternity you will be living in . smile ! i love you ! ! ! :) i couldn't even make this kind of gold up if i tried . :P on topic : you ... 17 in my last year of secondary education . joined a year or two ago . i love being in the water and i love casual swimming . on the other hand , i'm a pretty bad swimmer and i'm hilariously bad at most watersports , but it's still a lot of fun . sounds like if we ever ... i'm not lactose intolerant , but i do have ( light-ish ) cow milk allergy , if that counts . i'm also lethally alergic to nuts . i just have to eat one to make my throat swell , blocking my trachea , ... it's not my thing and i don't really get it , but if you like it , go ahead . who am i to judge ?
