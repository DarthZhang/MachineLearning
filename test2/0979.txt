' body temperature tends to be lower for corpses and zombies . however , a live human body and a deceased human body have the same number of particles - - - so structurally there's no difference . : wink : did it have a cheezy soundtrack ? how was the acting and plot ? : tongue : i'd rather be a human being than an intj : laughing : latest confession : broke up with my gf and told her some very cold shit in anger ... and i now feel a bit guilty about it ( even though it was all true ) . : sad : i can definitely relate to that . love defies all logic and makes us irrational . however , i have not quite given up on the possibility of being insane with someone that i don't mind being insane ... don't drink much these days , but when i did - - - ironically i become the life of the party . i turn into a full e with a heavy sprinkling of hilarious and a dash of obnoxious . or at least , ... well ... we're actually back together again ... i'm probably a glutton for punishment , but what the hell . i think i misunderstood a lot of her actions & words , so i felt i should give it another ... i'm also a dexter fan , although i can't say i have fantasies about him ... maybe rita ( rip ) lol i suppose it's possible you are referring to other fictional serial killers - - - but i'm guessing dex ... confessions ... hmm ... i've found that my creativity and imagination are at its peak when i'm at my lowest . thus , when i'm happy i can't write - - - when i'm not happy , i can write a novel ( and am ... omg . i'm with you on that one ! when i attempt small-talk ( outside of work ) i usually end up saying something really unusual and esoteric about an everyday topic and i end up getting this reaction : : unsure : i'll stick to ... the way you described it ... is so romantic and sexy . : tongue : wonder how an intj romance novel would read . i'd like to try that ... unfortunately , it's not the kind of thing that most people are able to tell you , or is readily evident when meeting . so what do you do for a living ? i see . and what ... if most estj's are like this one - - - i think i am going to be avoiding them in the future . it's just not a good match for an intj ( at least this one ); no offense to any estj's . intj's aren't your ... if it makes you feel any better , i'd trade types with you if i could . would make life easier . do you need a hug ? : tongue : at home working on my book . the book store ( but i don't stay long because as soon as i find what i want , i split ) . grocery store ... cause i kind'a haft'a . work , cause i kind'a haft'a . uhhh ... used to like them ... games like the total war series for instance . now i feel like they're too much of a waste of time . as much as i'd like to conquer the world , i won't substitute the real thing ... sad but true . i think , speaking for myself , i operate better when someone engages me with questions instead of expecting me to spit out interesting information with no real idea what the other ... any of these things in abundance , will not be tolerated . a little here and there , okay - - - nobody's perfect . i find your lack of faith disturbing . if by small talk , you mean : how's this weather ? did you see that game last night ? did you hear about so-and-so on the news ? etc .. etc ... hate it . i prefer talking about deep philosophical ... i'm with you on that to a point ... don't start putting pampers on me . although breast-feeding may not be ruled out . : tongue : hmm ... you enfp's actually exist ? never actually met one . i thought you guys were some mythical creatures ... like mermaids or unicorns or something . mystified by intjs ? sheesh ... you should ... i must diverge from my intj brothers here ... i do prefer feminine ; and at the risk of sounding chauvinstic i'll attempt to clarify ... feminine to me is the way a woman carries herself ( the flick ... welp , didn't work out . had to end it . it became emotional masochism . she now blesses my garden as fertilizer . ( kidding ) - close-mindedness - blind arrogance - disrespect - disloyalty - oversensitivity - lack of empathy - excuse-makers ( whiners ) i find socks to very elusive creatures ... and not very monogomous . : tongue : my humor tends to be very off-the-wall and unexpected . i usually paint a graphic picture with words that will elicit one of two reactions : the person that gets it laughs their ass of - - - or ... i like the way you phrased that :) i'm estimating the chance is pretty low at this point , but we'll see . we're going to talk about it this weekend as we've both identified that there is a ... lol that's interesting . we're going through a bit of a rough patch right now . we both live in totally different worlds mentally - - - she's hard-facts , precise , black & white and i'm approximate , ... hello guardians ... i tried searching for this topic already , and could not find it ... so here goes : i recently began a relationship with a confirmed estj ( i am an intj ) . i'm really into her ... if i come close to saying it , i automatically start hearing cheezy soap opera music playing in the background ... just totally kills it for me . even though the music doesn't really exist and it's in ... so , an intj , and esfp and an enfj walk into a bar ... the two e's talk to each other and compete to get a word in . the intj zones out , trying to imagine himself in death valley , simmering in ... there's been many successful authors who had to go the self-publishing route to get noticed by major publishing houses . first-time authors almost never get a chance unless they know someone or ... you should script it ... could be the sequel to kick-ass . : laughing : i can definitely relate to that . i don't share my writing portal with many friends or family - - - and i don't associated it with my facebook account for the same reason . there are bits of me in all ... i like to party when i'm snockered . i think when i get drunk i turn into an esfp ... completely different person . people seem to like that . in fact ... my friends would not let me join the party ... finish the joke you bunch'a dry humored , sarcastic introverts . consider it a challenge . and no , you can't insert a clever scientific formula or theory into the punchline . i have this recurring nightmare . i'm in hell . and there's this huge washing machine there ... along with piles and piles of my dirty laundry . the washing machine grins at me evilly . the devil ... i'm not sure how old you guys are ... but remember this . as you both grow old ... you change . you'll either change into people that are still compatible - - - or you will change into incompatible ... despite the stereotype , intjs do have emotions inside them , they just don't manifest themselves as much and we don't express them typically . the problem with that , of course , is we also have a ... speaking for myself , intj's tend to be very loyal once they have latched onto a partner . if anything , it is more likely you will break up with him at some point : tongue : i wouldn't worry about it ... i think the best approach to take is to write like it's a hobby . if something becomes of it , great - - - if not , you are doing a form of self-expression that you enjoy . i've taken that approach , and ... being that us intj's are not usually the most lovable or sociable types - - - do you find the whole dating ritual to be , umm ... painful ? i've gotten a lot better at it ( practice makes perfect ) , but ... never give up . you get better from writing , by simply writing . i'd recommend going on a site like writing.com : the online community for writers and sharing your works with other readers / writers . ... hadn't heard of the theory until now . so , if reincarnation does in fact occur , we are doomed to repeat the same stupid mistakes over and over and over again ? well , it would explain a lot . i ... that's pretty much what i do , you just explained it differently than me . : happy : i just don't go about explaining how the pieces all work in the story , unless it's somehow relevant to the plot ... i think part of being a writer is to discover your personal style . i also don't like boring the reader with too many facts - - - i prefer to write a colorful , visual introduction to what is going on ... i've always had an interest in science , so writing sci-fi forces me to research the fringe sciences - - - where it's mostly theory and little fact . i end up using this to explain elements of my ... ha ! i'd marry myself - - - unfortunately , i would probably be at my own throat within weeks of any kind of committment . alas ... intj = lone wolf . for me anyway .
