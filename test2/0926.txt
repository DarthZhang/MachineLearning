( decidedly ... the irony is that i can't fucking stand these groups of people . i am not sure that it is aristocratic , either : the whole thing smells of special snowflake syndrome . to me it is much more ... so you think that whatever system that you can devise would wipe out both poverty and crime overnight . interesting . it seems strange that nobody else has thought of a similar system to this or that ... actually , the evidence tends to suggest that the wealthier a society becomes , the less crime it has . http://thecivilisingmission.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/murders-vs-gdp-per-capita2.jpg in ... the whole basis of the battle between libertarianism and socialism is so completely vast that attempting to lure people from one side to the other with an argument is almost futile . i don't doubt ... this forum just hard-trolls me but i have to admit that from time to time completely alternative views have provided me with another lens . it won't surprise you to know that i am one of the people who doesn't think they are homophobic but uses gay , fag etc all the time . but they have wide connotations . i agree that language can take on ... i am not going to take the bait of your very childish attempt to be patronising , so i agree that conversation should end here . the meaning of language is static , that is why we have dictionaries . words do not change their meaning , it's only their application that grants them new meaning . i agree that you can describe a fish ... ? ! ? ! ! ? ! ? that isn't how language works : meaning doesn't change according to who you are talking to , meaning is static . if you didn't want to say that they were frivolous but you just wanted to say ... naturally . i am just saying that your description of betas only being interested in frivolous social activities is basically wrong . i am going off typing of sli for rand , lii can also be ... it's funny because i was going to mention rand but now i guess there's no need :) rand was a beta , btw . that's what i mean by idea-creation rather than idea-maintenance . er ok but usa is not a ... in other words you want to have your cake and eat it too ;) well , no , not quite these are good illustrations . delta - wswiki beta - wswiki you can go and live in a hut in the forest if you want then . yes , there are aristocratic quadras ( as you noticed , beta and delta ) and democratic quadras , h / e i think that the interesting thing ... well . firstly , the heritability of iq is not completely known . estimates range between . 5 and . 8 . intuitively i am inclined to believe the latter . however , i would suggest that the difference ... i'm normally quite keen to put differences aside and say ' ah , this is just a difference in thought process ' - but this time i think you are actually wrong . 1 - i understand you are talking bout ... any policy that involves more than one person is going to have to distinguish between different types of people , that's how government functions . i don't think it's true that value was ascribed ... what , of eugenics ? certainly not . even sweden practiced eugenics well into the 70s , i'm sure you know that . very interesting . i have seen dcnh but not come into contact with it that much . at first glance i think i am an n but i can't say for sure . let's be quite clear , however , that eugenics isn't anything to do with categorising people into groups . thanks for all the positive comments :) aristocratic reasoning merely structures logically ( symbol l.gif ) characteristics they have observed ( symbol f.gif ) in several individuals , being thus a logical connecting of the dots applied to ... you're looking at it the wrong way round . aristocratic-democratic is essentially whether or not sensing is blocked with thinking or feeling . intuition doesn't have anything to do with this dichotomy ... i'm extremely aristocratic . revolutions are violent , who would have thought ... some things are just better in the third world . the greatest find for a six however is supposed to be someone they can depend on . sixes should look for authority , the problem is whether or not they emotionally-trust that authority . that said ... democrats , lol everyone is so different ! ! ! 11 don't tell me what to do ! ! 1 i was really shocked . i did the eye test in the opticians and they manufactured the lenses to fit the frames in an hour . it was pretty surprising . im at work https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8705132/Personal%20Stuff/IMG_3038.JPG yesterday i stepped on my glasses . today i had to get new ones . https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8705132/Personal%20Stuff/IMG_3045.JPG and making it a bit silly . ... oh nooo did my colour change edit : thank god it didnt thanks guys . robespierre was a great man . ephemereality wrt the whole counterphobia thing , it only works for things which are an irrational fear , if you're afraid of being killed for instance then being shot at won't help cure your fear ... lol it would be funny if i knew you in real life . i don't think so tho : o edit - actually , what type is he , lol ?
