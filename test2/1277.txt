' holy shit i'm drunk ... sometimes i feel like i'm expendable . like when you're done with me , or bored of my , or whatever the case , you can just crumple me up and toss me into the trash . never have to think twice about ... bahaha , my bad . =P yeah , it's hard for me to decide what i believe . any type of philosophy i read and think about makes sense , is logical . but they are almost all logical , and you cant really prove them wrong . haha , ... well , that is definitely an interesting take on things . i'm going to have to read more from this mencius guy , i've never heard of him . i think that i could still , at least in my mind , justify the ... oh really ? how sad . i guess i never thought about that part of it . i always just thought it was really interesting . i can see , now , how that could complicate matters ... i thought you meant that you would fall asleep listening to recordings of lectures about jung , and that while you were sleeping these lectures would cause strange dreams . haha , how do you access the ... where would one find said lectures ? i cannot prove you wrong . this actually seems very similar to an idea i've been struggling with . that every decision , every thing a person does in life is a selfish one . even the situation where you ... haha , how so sad ? i can agree with that for sure . also , i remember the best thing i did to distract myself from this girl was to hang out with an enfp as much as possible . he provided so much entertainment and ... i agree , there is no real way to cope . i actually don't think the shorter one works very well . i remember doing such a thing , and the next time i saw the person all those feelings rushed back . ... this was epic . it made me think of this conversation i had with my friend once , about how cities were living entities too . there are times it sleeps and times it is awake . there is a time when all ... at least you're not one of the people who have sexomnia . ( like sleep walking , but sleep sexing ) . that could be even more awkward . the last little while all i wanted was for my boss to get fired , or quit . he's not good for the store in more ways than one . his boss just approached me and told me to make next weeks schedule , and ... i lawled . thanks for that . been a long day ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPZLhQwStc i don't know much about lincoln , but from what i do know i like him . you make him seem like an awesome guy . politics , especially in modern times , would be hard . i've had the temptation to try it , but ... gandhi said , be the change you want to see in the world . that's my favorite quote . i get what you're saying . i think , though , that the hate i feel for people is more appropriately called ... it definitely makes me feel better knowing i'm not the only one , haha . i see the problem . you reiterated the problem . i see possible solutions ... yet i'm not so sure that i'm ready to set down my ... i hate people . i've recently taken an interest in politics . not like ... following what this politician is promising , or who is going to be the next president , or any of that . mostly just worldly ... <confession> i used to be that kid that always sat in the corner , watching . i used to be a nice kid , caring , always ready to help people with their problems . my friends always told me to become a ... i haven't read any books yet , though i plan to get my hands on some . and i like the advice you give . some advice i received a little while ago is similar . they said to talk to the child , not as a ... k , so here's the deal . i met this girl ( intj ) about 8 months ago . we hung out , and very quickly created a sexual relationship . it was a mutual decision to keep it purely sexual . keep it as two adult ... you're not alone . the theory there is no such thing as a coincidence really slapped me in the face today . everything happens for a reason . i'm a firm believer . suck it . so , there is one girl i know . i met her a while back , but in the past few months we've gotten to know each other fairly well . i got attracted to her , and so i worked my magic on her , until she ... i'm terrified of the words i love you unless it's from a family member . it used to be just girls , but it's turned into anyone , men and woman alike . i'm still bitter from my previous relationship , ... huh , i'll have to check that out . i still haven't even finished please understand me ii by keirsey . its possible . infp's don't like to converse much . they just like to thank things . it's ok though , i relate . i read online once that they did a study , where they took a group of male and female participants ( complete strangers ) , and put them into couples . a male and a female . for extended periods of time ... sigh ... i felt the urge to come onto this site and attempt to release some emotions that are pent up ... lets see how it goes , shall we ? i'm effing sick of having this social anxiety . every time i ... edit = wrong post ... lawl . hoodoo-muse http://youtu.be/ughBjosWQak fits my mood pretty well at the moment ... ugh ... last night i had a terrible dream . i realized there was a thick layer of skin that had grown over my left nostril . i had to use my forefinger to puncture the skin , so that i could breathe ... i wrote this a few months back ... night terrors last night i dreamt of your face , you were nude , save net and lace . we lay in bed , passionate embrace , but then you ran , so i gave chase . ... for me , no that wouldn't be normal . it'd be a nice change though . sometimes my picky tastes gets frustrating . i mean ... i guess i can enjoy any music . but songs / artists have to pass the test to be ... wow , it sounds to me like you've a huge appreciation for this band . i know what you mean about all the emotion , the music i tend to love seems to flick a switch in my heart and soul , triggering ... it's an amazing movie . i highly recommend it . that's actually really interesting . i've only ever heard of people doing that sort of thing while intoxicated on psychedelic drugs ( acid , mushrooms , etc ) . i do admit , though , that sometimes while i ... i'll have to look some of these up . i love crystal castles , but i've never heard of any of the others . and i love that you listed pink floyd . one of my favorite bands , by far . but not so much ... haha this statement made me laugh . =P i agree , though , when i'm depressed i listen to music that fits my mood . it seems to help me ... put words to my feelings ? i guess ... i love nightwish . awesome ... friends can help each other . a true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel . or , not feel . whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine ... agreed . i love how you said spark imagination / new ideas . those are always my favorite songs / bands . when you say think i'm trying to be cool , would you care to list some examples ? i agree and relate to almost everything you stated . the only thing i don't relate to is your list of favorites . i think i'm just biased against most of them because someone i knew in the past loved ... i can relate to this completely . i don't think it makes us gloomy people , or we are nocturnal because we are gloomy . i read a think on the internet one time that night owls tend to be more ... i go a few days , with you absent from my thoughts . then ... when i stop to think , and i realize you've been gone from them , you take that as an invitation to invade my sanctuary . it's been over 8 ... i like what everyone says on this thread . its all good advice . i agree with building your own self confidence . don't worry about what other people say to you . my counselor says , if someone insults ... hey , if i can do it , you can do it . what are some of the suggestions your therapist suggested ? maybe you can try her suggestions regardless of what your mind tells you ? have you ever tried writing ... agreed . the people in this world become more and more isolated from each other every day . it all started with the radio and the television , and now its videogames and porn .
