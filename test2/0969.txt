according to the results you just seem biased against all sensing and all feeling . there's no way to tell from this . and tests suck anyways . i would suggest starting with the tefi pairing versus the ... my intj partner has no friends . none . when he was in high school he did hang out with other kids from what i'm told . a real friendship though , where he shared personal stuff , no , never happened . why does everyone think they're intj ? you guys have a massive amount of misstypes . why ? i've tried blogging several times . first time it was relative to mental health and psychology ( during my discovering the world years ) , second time related to veganism , and now i sometimes put up blog ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkNp5b6m4u8 maybe it's more complicated than that . i don't particularly think that being around family members is draining , but let's not escalate to going out for drinks with a couple of people and feel ... i get you . me gets thou . i get ya well . i quit things and started other things more than enough times to know that it wasn't the things ' fault , but my own mentality's fault . happiness is not ... no , it wasn't on purpose . you're not afraid to jump to conclusions or share kinda irrelevant personal information without making a point . i saw you're not sure about your type so i'm just sharing ... i've been in a relationship with an intj for two years now , and we've been living in the same house for one . so you could say that we know each other well enough , better than we would if we were just ... yeap , that's basically it . don't bother with the introductions , get to the pervy core right away . bleach . yeah deathnote is a given . a treat for the mind . bleach though , is more like art , needs more interpretation and i relate more . it surely must have something to do with who you pair with . there are different relationships between different types . like i am more dominant over an infp and less so over an intj . then again that ... 295122  2951 30 295138 some of my latest stuff . there's more on my instagram . when did the stikies get chopped down ? i've missed episodes . i draw a lot . all my shit be up on instagram , my username is antahon . i'm up for the game as well . this is my first post in a while , hi . i draw and sing and i like photography , yet i feel that no medium can satisfy me when it comes to expression . i just can't express what i want to , i have difficulty . my job is all about drawing ... i know and talk to lots of people everyday and my social circle is growing exponentially , all that because of work . i still have problems interacting with people and handling that kind of stuff well ... bleach . that's basic stuff . ergo proxy . serious one but very interesting . you have a good point but i can't agree about the fi . go read the socionics descriptions on isfp ( esi ) and infj ( eie ) . i believe infj is much more closer than isfp . i said that she's not a se user ... se users are all about interacting with the so much visual imagery at the moment it happens . they don't sit and write whole albums of sad songs about glorified memories and highly subjective point of ... i don't get where people see se in her . she's so obviously an si user as well as ti-fe . no true compass pointing north . a liquid for sure . this guy wittgenstein would enjoy this . it's either emotional climaxes or the beginning of the adventure for the main character or scenes i can personally relate with scenes with underlying meanings or mystery characters being very ... the other day it was the world of warcraft ost . today is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvwj_56ZUTM now you don't :P edit : oh obviously you do . i thought your post was older , before the name change . i don't have time for shit , i'm very busy and currently sick . also i'll be changing my username and soon no one will recognize me . bye friends , bye pretty world . pc_admin could you change my name into nastorm pretty please ? thank you . hmmno , i think it's just you . reality isn't objective . idk why there's a vibe of angry teen hormones . firstly because i can't be any of the other types . i've tried , but i just can't . also my intj says there's no way i'm non intp . lastly my infp says i'm an awful human being . confirmed ! that's weird haha . i find that not caring can get boring after many years . if i had to depict consciousness i would draw it all over my brains and around my brains , like outside of my head like a halo helmet . haha . it would probably be somehow connected to the ... would life be a thing ( exist ) if death didn't ? there's an interesting question . i'm prone to think that life and death are the same thing and not opposites . i don't think death is the enemy , although ... mostly insecure . aloof , distant and lazy too . yeah but if you look at it another way , they're not really logical flaws , they're more like practical flaws . it just feels more te than ti . like someone else said before me , ne ti enjoys just playing ... the fox song was totally amusing . it's difficult to not be overwhelmed by all the options when you're intp . the best weapon imo , is to have an awesome mentor and his wise guidance . otherwise , we're really slow by ourselves . 5 whole minutes ? i mean , i'm bad with names , but this sounds more like a problem . next time , if you can't remember a name after 20 seconds just give up man , no need to waste time like that . i'm guessing that your friend was aiming at an ethical debate , talking more hypothetically than practically . so , when you insisted on the practical impossibility of the matter , they told you that ... finally someone said it . i think this should get more credit than it already does . i feel you . it has definitely gotten better . i'm almost 27 now and it's still getting better as time passes . i believe the rate of change was greater at about 25 and on . i've posted this before and since it's ready i'll just paste it here . it might help you a bit . differences / similarities between me and my infp sister : she thinks a lot - i think a lot she's a ... i would guess that the ti-ne combination tends to move towards paranoid thoughts sometimes . even more so when those two functions are lower in the stack . indeed , your posts have an se vibe . yes exactly , too many people want to be nearly unconscious when the end happens . for me , i would prefer to be wide awake and see it all and experience all the death , because stuff like these just ... there's a lot of alcohol involved from what i noticed . why ? the natural enemy of a sphere is the lack of gravity . quotes are way more interesting . it's like opening a box and not knowing what's in . thanks are good but a bit boring . i'm wondering . if i changed my label to intj or entj or estp , would i get less fuss about my posts ? that's maybe an oversensitivity to a specific kind of bad behavior that hurt you ( maybe even unconsciously ) in the past ? i find that many intps and myself included , are mostly insensitive until you ... i think it's difficult for intps to be completely real when among a group . inferior fe and all . go ahead and others might follow .
