' very interesting point , and one that i've considered before . i agree that just because you can't express your idea well , doesn't make you wrong by necessity . but you also must consider that if you ... that's like asking , do normal people experience universe ? try , do intps experience a paracosm ? or live in a paracosm ? sorry for being pedantic . i'm leaving .. do you think some people have teeth ? yes , but what's your point ? do you think some entps are assholes ? some of any group of people are going to be assholes . nope , you didn't read my post . that's where i fit into more of a j mentality , though i am a good listener and desire to have someone challenge me to the point that they change my mind . but i do have an agenda and a strategy and am ... my scores are very mixed up . i'm talking about any kind of conversational conflict . i tend not to talk about anything inconsequential with people and stick to talking about religion , scientific ... i like the sound of your type 8 theory . i'll look into those again and report my findings . i'm an intp , or at least i've thought i was for a while . i've been doing some reading into entjs and , though i feel very introverted generally , i am very stimulated by verbal conversation - - really , ... right , so that's the end of our conversation . well aside from the ad hominem logical fallacy derivation poisoning the well you're using with the avatar comment , this post still just seems to be lashing out at me for not agreeing with you . i ... the theory that the earth was flat was never a fact , though people incorrectly thought it so . but we were talking about words which have meaning that we gave them , so there's nothing to dispute . but ... and i think i've made a fairly good case that metaphors necessitate interpretation and thus cannot be objective . i agree with this , but i would point out that i have a great intuitive sense , but i never use it even a little bit on definitive matters of thought . we must strive to be exact when charting undefined ... you making this about my ti use or your enfpness doesn't excuse your imprecise language . it is not only language because that's the only way you can convey your ideas . if you know what you mean you ... obviously , literally , necessarily some things must be left undone . through non-action , certainly nothing is physically done by the non-doer and anything that is done around him / her cannot be credited ... my introduction is far from clutter . the language is dense to fit as much meaning as possible into as small a space as possible . if you dispute that , quote the parts of my intro you disagree with or ... i'm not sure how this could be the interpretation . i have written out my thoughts for anyone to dissect , ridicule or discuss ; if people disagree with me and i counter-reason , that is the nature of ... you are welcome to stop posting , but i reason in a very firm way and it may seem obstinate , but i don't yield simply because someone tries hard to change my mind or tries to find a middle ground ... excuse me , but the mere fact that i disagree with you and require an actual answer to a problem , even if the answer is that it is unknowable , doesn't give you the right to use ad hominem attacks to ... i enjoy and respect sam harris , but his take on objective morality was fallacious sadly . he ( and you ) posed an objective moral and practical scale on a subjective goal or ethical eventuality . i think ... you are correct , but missing the point . time is finite in either direction . right , which leaves us with a problem of proof . recognizing this , for the person wanting to prove objective morality , puts all of their work ahead of them . i do this all the time , only out loud ( to the chagrin of my girlfriend ) . but not of objectivity . but in fact it was also revolving around a subjective truth . this is the sort of thing that sounds very deep , but must imply individual subjective interpretation . do nothing , accomplish everything . obviously that isn't literal , so , if you would , flesh out this ... it gave me istp . i'm really not an istp . it does look to be a groovy set of texts even though it teaches divination ( which is a mystic practice of super-naturalistic quality ) which hardly gives me more confidence in its wisdom . apart from ... i actually assert that there can't be objective morality and that we need a better word to describe our desire for it . even with god , the morality he gives us is subjective as he is the subject . this is the very essence of subjective morality . you , the subject , have come up with your criteria for a morality . well the religious use both objective morality as the reason for god and god as the reason for objective morality . it's circular and thoughtless . in fact my point is that whether or not you believe in a god , the existence of moral relativism isn't an argument in your favor . it doesn't prove anything . ok , now i'm respecting you a little less because you're just saying words now . this is completely contrary to reality . neuroscientists champion the concept of determinism which moves seamlessly ... you are very right , and thank you for posting against the majority ; respectable . morality must exist ? why must it ? well what is right differs from culture to culture and century to ... oh , i do not imagine nor claim that the average iq is declining , but the social script , at least in america , dictates that you have an opinion that no one can question , and if their beliefs are ... the more international debaters i watch the more i think i could agree , but i do see a disparateness of social convention in americans as a doggedness in holding beliefs . but , i am from america and i ... i agree , but you must also be open to entirely changing your position . going into a debate knowing that you're right is entirely fatuous . you may be very confident , but should never , in any ... what do you decide to naturally do ? conflict with yourself semantically ? yes . the point of a discussion is to argue for what you've reasoned and learned from books . what you just posted was intellectual laziness and authoritativeness in the same place . seen it twice . sam harris is wonderful , as are dawkins , hitchens and dennett . these public and formal debates often lead to the opponents speaking past each other and i would much rather a repartee ... the state of american debate form has devolved and been watered down to stating a point and changing it every time it's attacked until the end where you just restate yourself after having ignored ... i do no propose to be able nor will anyone truly be able to disprove the existence of any supernatural being or concept , in no small part due to the flexible and subjective nature to which these ... tnip for me . i'm a global paradox apparently . i can boil anything down into a single insult . my reference was fine , my spelling was off . she is an infj i've got more ! eddie izzard tyler , the creator you know , i could see this whole thing in the voice of george castanza i go by different things based on the mood of the site i'm on . gamer tags / gamer sites , i'm slashraid . <- came up with it so i could know that no one else would have it and it wouldn't need ... how do you get a pic to display here ? filling in blanks in your mind like that ; freud would have a field day with you . http://www.flickr.com/photos/79085275@N06/7077906799/ http://www.flickr.com/photos/79085275@N06/7077906799/ i can't see the picture , so i linked it above . i had a very geektool'd up version , ...
