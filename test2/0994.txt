' hahahahahaha . i just love my ability to read people and manipulate conversation . >:D mwahaha . it makes me feel powerful . i hope it went over well . :D for me , when i like a guy , i try to spend time with them as much as i can . i go out of my way to see them . i smile and laugh a lot when i'm around them . in the first few ... when people are rude to me , i get extremely offended and i pretty much always fight back immediately . but if it's one of my close friends , i ignore it and sweep it under the rug . i guess i don't mind ... oops i'm a little late on the uptake , but ... this has been happening to me too lately . i kind of put it in the back of my mind and focus on my lasting friendships . and i bring in new people into my ... i totally feel the same way . when i like someone , i try to talk to them all the time and see them as much as possible ... but i'm not very outward about it . i let them do most of the work at first ... who are you you're not welcome here . jk hi . :} talk to her as much as possible and tell her how you feel , always . make an effort to see her ; she'll want you to take the initiative first . she most likely won't think you're smothering her so don't ... ah that sounds horrible . /: i'm so sorry . something like this happened to me a few years ago , via internet of course . it really traumatized me , but also kind of pushed me towards people more . it made ... i used to feel that way a lot . but now i'm surrounded by a completely different group of people and i hardly ever feel like i'm being used . i think that's what your friend needs to do . /: he seems ... 1 . someone who is unreliable . like if i ask them to meet me at a certain time and they're always late . 2 . someone who doesn't take my help , or appreciate my concern for them . 3 . someone who isn't ... aw , no problem ! there are plenty of answers to your question here :] a good sense of humor is extremely important to me . i mean ... i laugh at a lot of things . but someone who makes me laugh will also make me happy . how could i not spend time with someone who makes me ... i have an insanely high sex drive in case you were wondering . there should be no shame in talking about sex ! appreciation , loyalty , and understanding . if someone is unfaithful to me , i will find out and immediately break up with them and not feel sorry about it . if someone doesn't appreciate me , i'll hold ... this is awesome ! i think i would much rather have the ability to solve any conflict , big or small . my boyfriend , an infp has done lots . he's been in europe for 2 weeks but apparently he has a surprise for me when he gets back ? eep . he's drawn me beautiful pictures . he's given me little gifts that ... i just take a recovery day . i sit at home and literally do nothing . i sleep in , chill out , eat whatever i want pretty much . haha . i don't leave the house . when i'm overwhelmed and have lots to do , i ... it kind of terrified me when i was a child , haha . i was easily frightened ... hi , infps ! i just wanted to say you all inspire [ ha ] to become a better person each and every day . i feel so comfortable around my infp friends ; i can talk to them about anything ! i'm gonna stop ... i want to be a clinical psychologist . making people happy and living to the best potential is what i breathe for . yep . :} i'm not necessarily a thrill seeker ; i have a lot of irrational fears . i think my childhood had an extreme effect on this but that's a completely different story , haha . i like doing spontaneous ... yep , i'm the opposite . i mean , i can only remember feeling that way with one person . it was really frustrating . but the enfj in me hates conflicts so i resolved it as soon as possible . i have so many ... yep , captain america so i could touch his body all the time ... and i can have someone to protect me i guess . thank you so much , you guys . i'm going to try my best to be their friend but if it's too much for me to handle , i have to accept it . i don't think you're crazy ! putting yourself in a feeling zone is great for performances [ acting , musical , etc ] . when you're singing a song , for example , you must put yourself in a certain feeling ... i've tested as an enfp and an enfj . my p / j is pretty much 50/50 . and my s / n is fairly close , but i always test as an n focusing on something far away is supposed to make your pupils dilated . thinking about someone you love or hate ... hm . try tensing your stomach as well . my appearance is extremely important to me ! almost to the point of vanity , which i have to be careful of . you won't catch me dead in a pair of sweatpants in public . i love shopping for myself and for ... hey sorry guys i hope i'm not too annoying yet . i have two friends who are extremely unhealthy psychologically and are always demanding attention . they're never happy and feel as if no one cares ... i'm happy ! and currently loling at the people who want to move to canada because of the ruling . oops . oh goodness . this is a rare occurrence for me . i rely heavily on intuition . i just continue to talk to them . i pick up on body language and tone of speech , like everyone else has said . or i just ... yes , sometimes i feel like i think too deeply about certain things . but they're always like ... meaningless . like television shows or movies for example . especially books . after finishing anything i ... is it bad that the first person who popped into my head was ellen degeneres ? yes . yes it was . haha . cuddling with someone i care about . :D i was actually an enfp in middle school and early high school . i really wasn't living for anything ; i just took my life day by day . i definitely wasn't as plan-oriented as i am now . i like outlining ... i can read people like books . i can see their intentions , and i know when they're lying to me . does anyone else do this ? and if so , what's a specific example ? just the other day i helped my brother ... i have an infp friend who absolutely loves crafts ! he's always drawing something new . he loves creating , whether it be visual art or even music . yay ! i think the answer to all of those questions is simply fear : fear of the unknown . sometimes it's really hard for me to step out of my comfort zone . like if i'm not completely at ease doing something ... i have . i didn't come clean . the guilt still lingers . but the way i rationalized it is ... sometimes a significant other [ who especially doesn't take the relationship seriously ] doesn't need to know ... my friend's mom is a career counselor . she's always making appointments . she works at home . she even helped me pinpoint what i want to do ! it's pretty low stress , though . she's a mother of 4 kids and ... hey we like you too ! we like everyone ! :D okay okay okay with the movie theater thing , i think he was just being nice . i mean , that's what i would do in that situation with no intentions of buying the person's sex or anything . he may be ... 1 . so you can learn from the experience ! it may not last forever ... but you'll certainly learn a lot about yourself ( what you want in a relationship and who you want to be in a relationship ) from it ... i'm sorry you're feeling like this . i think you need to sit down and physically write your feelings out . make a list of things to do . make a list of people to see . most importantly , make a list of ... people come and go , yeah . /: but i would confront her about it . be honest about your feelings . no matter the outcome , you'll feel much better about the situation after having a conversation with her , ... not gonna lie , tlc shows are my guilty pleasure . my strange addiction : watching my strange addiction . say yes to the dress ? yes please . it's actually pretty embarrassing . haha . i was always getting into mischief . i bossed my sister around to do stupid things with me , like climb the creek in our backyard . i looked up to pretty much every adult in my life . but i definitely ... career counselors find it useful ! obviously , haha . my family is really into myers briggs , and so are a few of my friends . i feel like the general public wouldn't be as interested though . those who ... being a leader isn't necessarily always for a large group setting ; you can be leader of only a few people . :] you don't have to picture yourself giving a lecture in front of hundreds of people , haha ...
