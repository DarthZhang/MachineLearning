' i've been working on a theory regarding ai replacing many ( dare i say , eventually all ? ) sensors in the coming evolutionary jumps . i mean , its shit theory , but there's some germination there . what you know and what you can explain and apply are different things . without jung , you wouldn't have the words to put to it and applying any kind of knowledge regarding then because wildly ... tears are lube no , i dated someone after realizing that to test my theory . i've been on this jung shit for about 4 years . ;) infj , intj , isfj ... i don't really see the point of a fourth choice . i live in ... you both want the same thing , therefore you both lack that which you want . ive dated an entp before , and there's comfort in familiarity , but after enough time and growth you learn that you don't ... boom shaka laka oooh , poop stories . one time , during masturbation , i came so hard i pooped a little . just a little . marijuana is a helluva drug . just keep challenging yourself in terms of staying open . and communicative . have fun . definitely . but don't be afraid to genuinely stroke your entp's ego , we love that shit . there's only a difference between what you said and what i said if you want there to be . i didn't imply that you should commit to any old asshole . identify entp . flirt enough until he realizes you're into him . ask lots of questions about himself . be open and honest and talk as much as you want . ( which won't be a ton at first anyway ) ... there's an intense depth to your self-knowledge , yes . but sometimes you miss what's right in front of you when it comes to love and lovers . he wants you to do the opposite . he wants you to dive in and look like you mean it . then again , like i said , maybe neither of you are ready right now . he seems to lack patience and you seem ... if you want to be with him , just explain to him that you see relationships and love differently than he does and you didn't even know what was happening at first . remind him that your differences , ... and you're not as clear as you think you are when you've kinda sorta made up your mind . which can be an infuriating thing to watch because i can remember actually seeing an infj girl change her ... i get ya . well , it's like this . he probably feels like he's chasing you because if he's like me , initiating conversation can be a bit of a chore sometimes if there's distance and i'm just chilling ... well , there's a certain vulnerability that comes with being in love that when faced with , i think many times i've looked for a logical way out . so , if he can sense on some level that he'd fall for ... i find myself dancing around infjs sometimes . you can be more sensitive than we are prepared for and so sometimes i find myself trying to put tough things through this fj filter . i think it's more of a lazy challenge for you to translate it into normal speak instead of metaphysical story-talk . basically it's a cop out and a funny way of not having to translate it ourselves . trying new things . no . instead , i look them both in the eyes , one at a time as i do awful , nsfw , things with the sausage . this causes my girlfriend to run out of the room , covering herself in shame and the pizza man's ... just my pleasure . where's the part where we get asked a question ? i'm tryna drop some muthafuckin wisdom up in this bitch . jealousy is one of the ugliest things about human interaction . learning to let go really teaches you what is truly important to hold on to . lol . not many intuits have ordinary upbringings . those with the n style of info gathering only make up roughly 16 % of the population . nerds unite ! in relative solitude ! i love seahorse and seahorse things . like blankets . towels . little bags . seahorses . forever . the struggle is real . i've known infjs from varying backgrounds , some abusive and some not , some wealthy and some not and some ultimately emotionally healthier than others . we are born , but malleable , and life tends to ... yick , assumptions and overs-simplifications do not for good friends make . i apologize for not meeting your minimum words per post requirements in essay format . i forgot this was a graded exercise . they care , but they'd rather know the bottom line . the only time they care about how you got to the conclusion you're persuading them to adopt is when you're convincing them you're right the first ... countless domino effects interacting with and changing the courses of countless other chains of causation since the big bang until this moment . it's huge math over insane spans of time , but it's ... sure , it boils down to simply cause and effect , really . superfun stuff . easier if you don't try to put words to it , but then it's difficult to understand and enjoy fully . it's all complicated and exists in a place that is so much more complex than spoken ... as a guy , i like having estp guy friends . once i get them on my side and vice versa , which can be an argumentative filled endeavor , they're the most loyal , get'r done minions an entp could ask for ... i'm a bitch , i'm a lover , i'm a child , and i'm a mother . i'm a sinner . i'm a saint . : o i can say , with confidence , that exploring polyamory has greatly reduced my jealous tendencies towards romantic paranoia . simply put , you gotta face your demons to own them . also , i am ... yeah , me neither . b ) lol . if it was behavior , then why do infjs frequently type as extroverts and why are entps commonly known as the most introverted extrovert ? i mean , one is clearly an e and one is clearly an i , ... sharing is caring , but sharing a disappointment is ... misery loving company ? you really went for it on this response . get Ã©m , girl . this is getting pretty complicated ... can i just be right while someone opposed and easily identified as such is considered wrong so that i can get on with my day already ? edited for clarity ... that is what you meant to say , right ? entps enfps estps esfps intjs i have to resist responding from the guilty feeling of having been given too much credit ... technically i just failed . i'm always impressed with a healthy infjs ability to behave in a way that makes ... narc that shows a complete misunderstanding of sociopathy . you would see your psychopathic traits as a positive because you're psychologically incapable of doing anything else . your egotistical narcissism ... there is no difference between psychopathic and sociopathic . the only real definition or distinction is the lack of a conscience . it is complete and the socio / pscyhopath does not miss it . of course , ... same . i sometimes will type one thing and remain engaged and responsive in an unrelated face to face conversation . it used to creep my roommate out . :D glad to know its a type thing . same . once , ... i also smoke marijuana . with my toes . the process is painfully slow and the writing is awfully illegible ... the whole thing is a complete waste of time . i'd write with my hands but , like , i'm a visionary . you gotta ... i pooped in the fridge and i ate the whole wheel of cheese .
