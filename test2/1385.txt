' i was stuck between istp and istj for bezzerides but think the recent episodes actually go in favor of the former : she's obviously not clint eastwood but the proper attitude seems superficial : she ... if you haven't seen the show i highly recommend it , an 80s period drama about an east german spy in west germany . but onto the types : martin - isfp ( ? ) lenora - istp tobias - intj annett - ... that's exactly the vibe i got from woodrough , he's obviously a repressed gay / bi and mostly marrying to keep up appearances because of some ( imagined ? ) social stigma . also even though he has problems ... except for her completely lax attitude , odd lifestyle and introvertedness , basically everything lol . i can see a case for se but why fi ? i've known some maladjusted / angry isfj males who have ... i don't really know what system that is but where does she use any ne ? it's not like she's using ne in a concrete way , she's outright just explaining things mechanically the way an se-ti user would . she has a lot of the mannerisms an istp girl i knew did , gonna nth istp . edit : where do people see ne ? the first video is a perfect illustration of her lack of it , instead of connecting the ... velcoro - isfp ( despite his antisocial traits , he's clearly a dominant fi user ) . bezzerides - istp ( although she seems like a prototypical istj she's not particular strict , just driven ) . woodrugh ... yeah by the finale it was clearly ne , it's almost like the more jimmy matures the more abstract his thoughts get like his epic meltdown and desert metaphors , my guess is it's clearly from living in ... actually having him be istj makes a lot more sense since he never really had an ni master plan but did have te and si and fi . a lot of that can actually apply to se , the issue is how the function works not just its behavior : for instance socrates and epicurus were both philosophers , inventive , clever , etc . while the ... my issue with immediately labeling saul an entp is that this show toned down his ne , in every situation he sees everything superficially like an se-dom would ; although you can argue his criminal past ... there's obviously overlap with breaking bad characters but this show has its own originals . jimmy / saul - extp . ( in bb he seemed to be intuitive but here he seems to use se ) chuck - intp kim - ... i always got an intj vibe from anakin / vader ( or i-tj at the least ) , he talked about needing a strong leader but at the same time thought obi-wan was too controlling , had obvious fi when he proclaimed ... i agree with almost all of these but milo seemed more i , iirc he was pretty low-key and not well defined . it's that show about the 80s computer business . anyways my guess is : joe macmillan - entj , decisive , machiavellian , visionary but has strangely easily hurt feelings ( inferior fi ) . gordon clark ... i thought wlc was infp . well i got that he was an ni and se user ( mystical theories combined with ' matter of fact ' / ' superficial ' presentation ) so immediately thought infj , then it seemed like he was a clear fi user based ... his iq is estimated to be between 190 and 210 . any guesses ? i think he's actually an isfp . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggur-Ca2nzs i'd say the same although tyler could also be estp . i kind of go back and forth on the show , at first the humor was spot on but it's been kind of declining , especially the recent episode . i thought about intp but he seems too emotionally ... my guesses : richard - isfj or infp ( ? ) erlich - esfp big head - isfj bertram - intj it's not clear what his ideals were prior . he made it a point to say that his strange personality / beliefs were fixed and the reason why he joined the police ( although obviously his traumas made it ... i saw the movie and from what i remember basically everyone was istp ( except for the bishop guy was esfp ) : tongue : yeah if you want a good example of a j , look at papania especially in the last episodes ( probably an istj ) . i was actually kind of bummed that cohle ( somewhat ) changed in the end ; not that i agreed ... well in whoever's defense it is also an hbo show but yeah the sentiment is right . i don't get why everyone is typing him as a j , cohle's first speech was pretty bizarre and creepy for anyone ... bump , i read a fantastic comment about the two characters : rust is dark but has a kinder center and marty is nicer superficially but with a darker center . this is also a decent characterization of ... i got infj for cohle with a very strong 5 ( literally ) . both his views and thought processes are pure mystical ni which he sees first and then has to use reign in with ti . at least i think it makes ... seth - estp evan - isfj - i didn't get any kind of fi from him can anyone explain that ? ( although he does kind of remind me of an infp i knew ) . fogel - isfp - pure unashamed fi along with se . i know it's great ! rick seems pretty ne with his different inventions and ti logic ( like that dream episode where he figured the freddy guy wouldn't say to hide ) . morty seems to have fi moral outrage ... my guesses are : rick - entp morty - isfp dad - istp mom - infp based on watching the second season i got : frank - entj , obvious repressed fi when his ego is injured . i don't see how it's even possible to see fe in him . claire - infj zoe - istp lucas - ... looking back i think he's actually istp . in his youth he was interested in race cars which is more se but definitely introverted sensor thinker . honestly no idea : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxqmwEcKaxI irving kristol - enxp http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9kGFUfm8rU it's worth pointing out that istps and infjs use the same functions but cruise is probably a bit more on the ti-se side ... i actually think entps are more likely to be self-deprecating , fi has a tendency to be boost your ego unless you have a low-self image . although from interviews he does seem more enfp ... lol inxjs don't have psychic powers ( ! ) ? he didn't see his death in a dream , he had a slight hallucination from being tired and saw himself being with two faces in the mirror ( it might have been multiple times , or a few times in one ... my guesses are : marty - entj jeannie - isfj doug - infj clyde - esfp monica - isfp anyone else ? that could also be an example of poorly developed fi or his moral standards are whatever benefits me . archer - esfp lana - intj cyril - ixfj malory - estj pam - estp krieger - entp cheryl - esfj brian : infp allison : infj john : entj andrew : isfj prinicipal : estj allison is actually quite like a lot of young infjs ( albeit exaggerated ) . even though a lot of people type king as intj or infj when you seem in interviews he comes across a lot like an isfp . guesses ? it could just be the environment and habits , when i'm in college it forces me to be energetic , relatively organized and social and when i'm not i fall back on the lazier intp habits . this might come off as a strange question because of how obvious it should be , but i can't tell if a friend of mine is an entp or infj . when he talks in person he comes across like a quieter ... i think it's actually the opposite , intps are considered more judgmental types ( ti is a judging function ) . although they might come across as less lazy when going out because ne needs external ... walter - infj , he clearly had fe with his ability to lie and connect with people . jesse - esfp skyler - enfj walter jr - isfp hank - estp marie - isfp gus - intj mike - istj gretchen - ... i think exactly the opposite , jesse is very extroverted when we first see him and even when he is emotionally withdrawn it's usually with lots of other people ( like when he threw that party even ... bilbo - istj ( he seemed more fi and si to me ) . gandalf - intp ( much more fe with regard to dwarfs in first film at least ) . thorin - isfp gollum - infj smaug - intj bard - istp sorry i don't ... based on his quotes he seems like a clear intj . he also fired his housemaid when she made a small lie to spare his feelings .
