' it's freaky how much i can relate to this . lol , i feel the same way . my sister is an intp and i feel like together we're sherlock and watson . :) i have a hard time with this . mostly because i tend to believe what i hear . in the workplace i definitely feel like the boring , narrow minded one . when people complain about isfjs , i just want to ... i saw somewhere that whitney was supposed to be isfj , but i'm not sure if it was accurate . :/ sorry ahead of time if this comes out as more of a rant , but i was on the other side of this just recently , so let me explain it . i had a co-worker with a crush on me that was casually paying me ... i actually have a pretty deep voice and it only gets deeper the sleepier i get . although , for some reason when i talk to children , strangers , or animals , i use this extremely soft , high pitched , ... i would probably love it if i didn't have reynauds . i can't handle the cold well at all . i think it's the prettiest season though , and i enjoy the fresh , cold air when i am out for short periods of ... my sister is an intp and we get along great . we're practically each others best friend and we have a very easy time communicating . i've found that growing up with her helps me to understand any other ... if i'm learning how to do something specific , then i have to learn it by doing it and have someone walk me through it a few times . sometimes i can learn it after going through it just once . try to ... ugh , i always come off as being an air-head because of this . i have a delay between the joke and my outburst of laughter . it's embarrassing . : frustrating : these are both so true of my istp cousin . i feel like i can read people pretty well , but then again , i've heard a lot of people say that isfjs are paranoid and aren't all that great at it . also , i've met isfjs that are terrible at it as ... to be honest , i never flirt , nor will i ever understand how to do it . it's just not natural for me . on the other hand , i don't mind being flirted with as long as it's extremely subtle . isfjs pick ... my words exactly . xd i deeply agree with what scamper _22 said . often times with isfjs , the real problem isn't anything that you'd assume right off the bat . also , you have to settle with the fact that you're never going ... i feel like i'm always myself , but i just show whatever side would fit the situation best . i might not be completely honest with everyone all the time , but it's not just about making everyone happy ... this is me exactly . super serious until someone says something that makes me smile and laugh uncontrollably . xd i can actually relate to this . i'm an extreme introvert , to the point where i just want to be alone for weeks at a time . on the other hand , i've gotten comfortable enough with my co workers that i've ... i totally agree . it's like we think with our emotions and we need time to put it into words that others will understand and relate to . i was just curious to see if this was a common thing with isfjs or if it was just some social quirk or nervous habit of mine , but do you ever find that you can't help but smile all the time ? for ... all the time ... i personally think that isfjs would make pretty good actors actually . i guess it depends on the person though . i've always dreamed of acting . i love emotion . i think we might be a little less apt to ... i feel this to an extreme . in fact , i was thinking about making a post like this until i stumbled across this one . i've always felt that everywhere i go , i'm just a part of the scenery . i listen ... haha , no , it's just the principle of the thing i suppose . it sounds very unspecific and lazy . i don't really care though , i'm just picking . xd i'm glad i'm not the only one that hates this . i'm a cashier and everyone around me uses this expression , except for me . i've never understood it . i used to have anger issues until my sister taught me something over a matter of years that finally hit home as i got older . you only get angry because you let yourself . getting worked up over ... all the time . i feel like i don't have the right to give advice without proving that i know what i'm talking about due to past experiences . i personally want to know that the person telling me what ... this is something that i understand because i do it all the time , though i find it very hard to express in a way that would make much sense to a non-isfj , but i'll try my best . us isfjs are ... triple minds apparently , because i didn't read yours before posting either ! lol . xd before answering , i should note that i'm a christian and hold to certain morals . i can also admit to being rather insecure , so i'm not sure if my answers would be true for many isfjs . and please ... the only two people i'm close to are my sister ( intp ) and my best friend ( esfj ) that i've known for as long as i can remember . i could also count my cousin ( istp ) who feels almost like a little brother ... ^ this was totally me as well . i'm sorry to hear this . D: i'm not going to pretend to know what's going on , because unless you know both sides , it's hard to say . but i'd just try to remember that isfjs will try to avoid any ... i love intjs . i like their relaxed demeanor and gentleness , and i find them easy to do things with . my only complaint is that every one i've met is actually very insecure . they hide it very well , but ... i was just thinking about this the other day ! i'm the same exact way , but i think it expands into my other senses as well . for example , i was walking out in the rain with a hoodie on , and the ... as an isfj , i've never told anyone that i loved them without them telling me first . my father ( infj ) always says i love you to me , and i answer i love you too , but i don't normally say it on my ... my issues stem down from my ocd . i feel like i'm always sitting around , waiting for the right moment when i'll be able to make everything in my life completely organized to the point where everything ... well , i get along with my sister ( intp ) really well , so most other intps i can understand pretty well too . i guess sometimes it's hard for me though because for some types i've only known one person ... i have ocd tendancies , so does that count ? i clean whenever i'm upset . :P i'm sure my sister could list all of the silly things i do , but i guess i just don't notice them . most of the time it's ... maybe it's just me , but i've never liked opening up to people very much . i think it's because they always come to me with their problems first , so i don't get to do my share of complaining . i've just ... initially my sister typed me on her own as an isfj and after taking a test online , it confirmed it . this actually doesn't surprise me , as intps have the same functions as us , but in an ... superior i've never been in a relationship to begin with , but i know a few istjs in real life , including my mother . i have to say that i just don't get along with them . i think they're great at a friendship ... i can completely relate actually . this kind of reminds me of how i was getting stressed about not having photo albums in order and such . i feel like i need a full record , in order , of my past in ... actually , i'm talking about full-blown theatrics . usually said person will bring it up here and there like , well i'd have time if i hadn't had to do that ( hint hint ) . i might get paranoid easily , ... i'm mixed about this one . i don't let just anyone use me like that , but i do tend to get pushed around by people that i don't want to upset . i think it's because i'm attempting to avoid any drama ... i'm not sure why , but i've never been able to succeed at anything i do , even if i work at it for years . i feel like i'm always comparing myself to my sister though . she's an intp , so she picks up on ... i'm not sure if someone has already mentioned it , but i could swear that leonardo da vinci was an intp . growing up with an intp has exercised it considerably for me . xd ^ these are all really true for me , especially the last one . i'm frequently depressed about it actually .
