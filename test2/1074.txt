' my aunt and her husband just came to visit and stayed with us . i've never really known them , but it was great to really talk with them all weekend . her husband was a chemist and is extremely ... i see fragments of the waning moon through the tree and smoke . the air is cool and damp . i contemplate family and many lost years . i wonder if there is a god . if he is there , can he heal all that ... no . but i get really close . i'm sure when i was younger , i was a much firmer p . just start your list with procrastinate ... this is the p vs j function of personality . i'm right in the middle there . i like to get things done ! i'm very scatterbrained , too . i need to make lists in order of priority to stay on track . it's quite relieving to cross items off the list as they're completed . let's have a long heart to heart about us i want my team to go to the world series . and a bj . ok , definitely the bj . xanax ! when i fix things . i usually pick apart the overall design of it . most off the time , i think , who is the idiot that thought that was a good idea ? how do they still have a job ? best example ... it's fun toying with stupid people . more fun when they have no idea . that's funny ! he should use lube . antacids are your friend ! i have some hellacious reflux from time to time . when i get stressed , it gets out of control . i love this answer . i really think you and i could be great friends . can't go wrong with pizza . me too . sorry for the miscommunication . maybe not . i'm referring to mafia wars on facebook i was into it until i really got started . like when it was a struggle to build the business . after i had enough property and weapons , the challenge disappeared and i got bored really quick . those sound like normal distributions to me . finding t given levels of certainty . shame on you for skipping ! spinal tap the movie . one of my favorites . so entirely inappropriate ! http://tapatalk.imageshack.com/v2/14/10/04/e7aefb06ad32ec8faec028e1ca4a2e91.jpg i did one for about 6 months . it got boring really fast . i watch a lot of netflix , but to me that's still tv . i can't stand the commercials . let me explain what i mean . regardless of whether there was a being that did in fact create theuniverse , or it was a natural occurrence , we call that point of creation god . whether it was spoken ... i did pretty well in stats , but i'm not interested in any sexual favors . :D what are you currently working on ? normal distributions ? i do however believe that is the extent of some people's intellectual capacity . the human body is a mystifying machine . just think of all the things happening without a single thought . your heart pumps , tie lungs breathe , hair grows , food digests , etc . and that is without ... i think i bounce back and forth . i can't stand to sit and ponder too long . i have to think of a plan in broad terms , then just get after it . i work details as i go . ok , that's twice in 2 days . what is wrong with me ? back story : a friend of mine at work lost her husband this morning . we used to ride to work together before i moved . her husband did work at my ... i like the first cause argument . oh boy ! that's a question with a million answers . i was taught it's a sign of weakness . you can only cry at funerals . other than that , you're a pussy . it's hard to reprogram that . it would be really beneficial , though . my wife is a ... i wasn't full on sobbing , if that's what you mean . i'd need someone to punch me in the nuts , then . i cried yesterday . can't tell you the last time i did that . i wanted to hide so no one could see me . i'm a man , we don't cry , right ? ! i bought contacts 2 years ago . they dry out so bad after starting at the computer all day , i just went back to my glasses . wow , we accountants are dryer than a nice cabernet . here's my baby . i don't know if you can see it , but it's got a quilted maple top . made of solid mahogany . absolutely gorgeous , and sounds even better through my fender hot rod . 65 watts with ... my lp is awesome ! i custom ordered it about 11 years ago . this whole city is going to have a hangover tomorrow . nobody is going to get anything done . i'm not into huge purple cocks . on the other hand , if it was black ... there is nothing worse than mediocrity ! if you have the ability to be exceptional in any way , you should take full advantage . to not do so is disgraceful . if love to be acknowledged and appreciated . i'd also like that wrx or an f - 150 . i'd like a custom surround sound system upstairs and down . throw in a fender telecaster and a gibson hollow body ... i don't hate being an american , but i am ashamed by it sometimes . does cider fall under the beer category ? i'm not being a smartass , just wondering what other people think . my family is from wisconsin . tons of german immigrants in the 1800 ' s . those people know how to do it right . why would you get a tattoo unless is something that has great meaning for you ? that shit is not coming off . i just realized that as much as i talk about food , people might think i'm a total fatass . i assure you , i'm not . someone to make me a huge country breakfast . biscuits and gravy , bacon , scrambled eggs . maybe some hash browns . and serve it up with a side of sweet lovin ' . had a dark hofbrau tonight . german beer is the greatest . here are the ones i've tried warsteiner warsteiner dunkel weihenstephan grimbergen hofbrau each and every one is great . my favorite ... 2nd thought . mike moustakas is a piece of shit . either hit the baseball or go away asshole ! i keep having this image of having a huge party at my house . we'd all get really drunk . i'd make some great bbq . i'd just play my guitar and sing all night . we'd all sing a few together . i would ...
