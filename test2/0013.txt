you turn out to be a different person . the confident entp turns out to be very vulnerable emotionnally , full of fears of rejection etc ... oh my gosh thank you for all this . my bf must be an infj as you describe it perfectly . he had one of those fe moment last week . it was very draining for me to try to understand him when he was just ... thank you so much for this advice ! i see you know well entp / infj relationships then :) wow ! thank you so much for this deep and interesting answer ! this describes so well my relationship to my bf ... we don't have to make things work . it just works . first time it happens to me in my ... ok that's interesting . i still have doubts which xnfj is my bf . he has some characteristics of the 2 types ... i would lean more toward infj but not 100 % sure ... one thing sure , i need more to go out ... a question : the fact that an xnfj prefers one / one relationships ( even though he claims , he's social ) , is this a sign that this person is rather an infj ? or do enfj also prefer 1/1 interaction ? happy about my relationship to my infj ! sartre was either intj or intp camus might have been an infj or infp i think . i am an entp involved with an infj . but maybe this isn't the right way around for you :) my boyfriend ( apparently infj ) and me ( entp ) -> i wanted to share this on our first conversation : the first time we talked together a little deeper , he got impressed how intelligent i am ( i am ... this . thank you for this . i was wondering which nfj is my bf . he's clearly an infj according to this difference ( 1 follow vision 2 help people ) . no wonder then why he's just a revolution in my ... hey guys , i think you are right . i talked about this with him . it sounds like as an entp , i am hard to read . i very clearly stated yesterday that i have feelings for him without him asking . i tried ... my guy is sending me 2/3 texts each day on how much he's happy to see me again etc ... if i were not into mbti , i would find this a little too much . but because i know the mbti , i try to respond in ... goodolddreamer your answer is especially interesting . the thing about respecting bondaries in particular . my bf which i suspect to be an xnfj is pretty like this . even though i offer him to come over ... i know there's a similar thread on the forum . but i wanted to take it to an other direction now . i got the impression from the other thread that you all feel awkward with expressing your love in ... a very close friend told me the other day how different my new bf is from the last one , which was very different from the last one , which was very different from the last one etc ... she thought , it's ... this is totally irresponsible and immature in my point of view so , do you mean that if an xnfj is into expressing his feelings often like : i appreciated the time spent with you , i miss you , i am so much eager to see you again etc ... and flowers etc ... , ... so you're a bunch of optimist people . interesting ! thank you so much for all those interesting informations . yes in deed , it's a new relationship . you are totally right about this . also interesting to note that entj and infj could come across as ... i don't talk about leaders personalities . for me alpha are ambitious people who want to succeed in life . not automatically leaders ! sure ! females are welcome ! yes , i am wondering about this guy . thank you for the video idea . i will check . he's very xntjish in a professionnal environnement but i suspect him to be an hidden infj at heart . he even got an entj ...
