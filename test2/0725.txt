' intj , i like my coffee like dessert . very sweet , and very creamy . i've never fainted ... 1 ) do you like tea ? specifically hot tea on occasion i'll have a cup of tea , but usually i'll reach for a cup of coffee . if i do have tea , it's very sweet . 2 ) do you often think about society and ... fixed my name . :) really though , if my pants or socks are uncomfortable , i'll take them off and leave them in my bed . 6/10 it's funny ! my vision sucks . i got my first pair of glasses when i was 11 , i wore them for the first few months and then never wore them . i got contacts a year later , and i've almost always worn them since . i ... - i really love to pick at things . my skin , my nails , my shoes ... i used to pick at my scalp until it would bleed , and then i would harvest those scabs later . - i play with the piercings in my ears ; i ... christina yang from grey's anatomy ... :) i'm an intj , and the first time i was sorted into gryffindor . that was my beta account . i made a new account yesterday and was sorted into slytherin . so intj is ... slytherdor ? intj , my bedtime is never consistent . sometimes i'm just exhausted and go to bed soon after dinner , and sometimes i'm wired and won't go to bed at all . i sometimes go to bed according to what time ... i'm afraid of spiders . also , being completely worthless . i'm an intj , and i loathe academic writing . getting my ideas and everything down on paper is a pain in the ass for me , i have everything in my head but i'm terrible at getting it out . i'm in ap ... i have the tendency to pick my skin and trim my cuticles . stalk their facebook profile and attempt to ( awkwardly ) flirt with them . i have no idea what i'm doing . the only one i know of is just sort of ... derpy . he isn't aware of what he can't do and what he doesn't know . he thinks he's smarter than he is . my biggest problem in life is actually sitting down and getting stuff done . i can contemplate and plan everything out , but when it comes down to actually taking action , i fall short . it takes me ... my family calls me their little sheldon regularly . i've dabbled in all sorts of arts before finding one that i really liked , including but not limited to drawing , acrylic , metal working , ceramics , and graphic design . i have a huge interest in graphic ... i have eight piercings total . three in each lobe , and then i have my left tragus and my right conch pierced . hopefully i'll soon have a daith piercing on my left ear . i love body modification in ... fever dreams-circa survive :) personality type ? intj enneagram type ? 8w5 favorite color ? teal / red / gray favorite genre of music ? alternative , acoustic favorite subject ? computer / english favorite personality type ( s ) ? my own ... i got a bat ... hahaha . i'm an intj . i absolutely agree . i can't stand it when something is brought up , and if i don't understand the person's viewpoint they just say nevermind or let's just forget about it . i can't simply leave ... i have few people that i consider myself friends with , those and my family are the only people i connect with . i never find myself longing for or missing people , even when it's been a while since ... intj's are ... 1 . ) geniuses - not always . i've always considered myself intelligent , but i know that i'm not a genius . 2 . ) psychopaths - no . 3 . ) no feelings - i have feelings , although few people ... my best friend is an infj , and i've never met a pair of best friends that function as well as we do . it's odd , really . dark brown , intj it sort of depends which class i'm in . one of my computer classes is just a bunch of labs using different media programs , and i already know how to use most of them . that gets old really fast . i think i define underachieving as being lazy and just sort of unmotivated . throughout high school , i never want to do anything . i didn't do my homework for the first few years , and this last year ... aka myself . is anyone else like this ? these . i hate it when people i don't really know touch me , which seems to happen a lot . or when people make suggestions that aren't asked for , it drives me insane . scientific atheist :) i suppose i could see it from that point of view . it's just repetitive , and gets old . i also don't like to be told things that i know for myself , especially if it's about stuff like this . and no , ... hahaha i agree with you . no ... i didn't . i love memes , especially the rage comics . i like that i can relate to them when i can relate to nothing else , hahaha . when people give you opinions that don't mean anything whatsoever , and repeats said opinion whenever the topic is brought about . for example , whenever my dad asks if i've applied to any schools , i ... intj-teal , red , and all shades of gray . most people think then extroverts are better than introverts ... i prefer introverts though , all of the extroverts i know like to think aloud and it really bothers me . do you like my eyebrows ? i couldn't lie . i'm an atheist , and intj :) '
