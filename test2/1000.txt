' lol . you're probably right ... it's just , i kind of have always wanted an explanation to myself . mbti offered that in a way , but there were still holes . then i took the enneagram test , and it ... 5 really isn't . it's not common , but not terribly rare , either . it's usually a thinking type . what i guess i am concerned about is that all enn types i am getting are either very uncommon or ... so , every single time i have taken the mbti , i score infp . i have no doubt that i am infp . usually , infps have an enneagram type of 9 , 4 , or 6 . i've never scored any of these . i consistently get the ... 234938 no makeup . because simplicity is beautiful . 225794 threw on some red lipstick . i felt fancy that is one of my favorite songs ! ! :) 222770 hey everyone . how are you guys ? i have had a rough few days ... but coming here always makes me feel better . there is such a strong atmosphere of acceptance and being understood that is hard ... enfp and istp . terrible match . especially if the enfp is unhealthy ( or the istp is unhealthy , obviously ) . there is always an immediate attraction to someone different than you , but this is ... lol . god you're such a typical enfp . that is exactly what my enfp best friend would do . however , unlike other types , who would put up with your roller coaster of emotions , an istp won't . they don't ... - attacks you with love - obviously , there are many infp writers . is there a thread to share our writings ? if so i haven't seen one . i would love to read some of your work . other personality types are welcome as well , ... 208090 d runk selfie .. fuck love guys cant do thar shit an i live you all so much 202090 thought i would come by here and be a little vain by posting a b / w edit .   ... kay . that's all . i'd agree with what you guys are saying . i have definitely overestimated my ability to see someone's pov before . however , i typically don't let the other person know that . i rarely relay my own ... strongly agreed . my best friend in high school was an enfp , and on the surface , we looked completely different . she was loud , bubbly , hilarious , flirty , etc . and i was the friend of that girl ... i also hate the whole sweet infp thing . i don't get it . actually , among the people who know me the most , i have been called a sarcastic bitch . something i didn't even take offense to , because i ... i have enfj and enfp friends who are incredibly unreliable . to the extent that i have literally lost money in gas or concert tickets because they never showed up . i didn't know this was an infp ... ha . then i'm not smart . i was always way too nervous to cheat on tests or exams , plus the one time i did , i got a 100 % and felt awful about it . even though it was just on 2 questions ... lol . see , that's what i mean . i hardly consider trading answers for homework as cheating . lots of places have study groups for that anyway . this girl acted like i was evil or something though . lol . and i ... lol . typical enfp attention span . xd jk . kinda plagiarism is much different than what i'm talking about . i mean predetermined answers for a study guide the whole class was given . :p obviously ... what are your thoughts on this ? i have always been an excellent student . straight a's , valedictorian , all that junk . so , i obviously work hard for good grades . but , sometimes i do cheat . never on ... no ... when people tell me i'm weird i am always surprised . not that i'm not weird . i am , i guess . i have strange habits like talking to myself ( often ) , preferring to sit alone in a crowded place ... maybe ... i don't ever intend on being condescending though . it is just an impression people have of me when i get into arguments with them . it actually often times hurts my feelings when people tell ... the whole emotionally weak and fragile personality aspects of an infp i don't really identify with . i have always been very bold with my opinions . to the point of aggression and being ... old thread , but those are my favorite to comment on . haha . i bring them back to liiifffee . so , i had an ' eating disorder ' for 5 years , and the last 2 years it was extremely severe . the ... haha . you guys definitely like to be perceived as being an individual . however , i feel like that is one of the things you probably have in common with most people . everyone wants to be different to ... is this a rare combination ? i saw that usually , intps are 5w4 . i have taken the test at least 10 times ( i like to make absolutely sure of my results ) . this was just an example of one of the results i ... romantically , men . sexually ? i am willing to try it all ! ;) i guess that makes me bisexual ? even though i wouldn't get into a committed relationship with a girl . i can't say i get where you're coming from . perhaps you're intp ? my entire life is a metaphor . i am constantly comparing things and making philosophical definitions of what humanity has become . psychology . everyone always looks at me like i'm crazy , because there are apparently ' no job prospects for it ' . but i am not one to care about money . i would be happy working as a school counselor ... feeling uncharacteristically happy today . all smiles . :) 179522 haha ! i feel this way all the time ! i wouldn't say i'm incompetent though , it's just with stuff that i don't know how to do yet . it seems to me , that i get overwhelming anxiety from being asked to do ... i am very quick to anger sometimes , and also extremely competitive , which don't seem like infp traits . but those are the only two that really fit me . i use a lot of intuition . if anything , i ... i have been told i am an excellent writer ( technically speaking ) , by all of my hs teachers and college professors . do i think i'm good ? since writing is what i ultimately want to do with my life , i ... oh , didn't read the rest of the post . haha . why we work ? we are natural partners , and can feel what the other is feeling . we share the same sense of humor ( that is very important for me ) , we both ... i like compliments sometimes . i can usually see right through flattery , and don't pay any attention to those compliments . or if someone says something really nice about my character when they don't ... currently , enfj . <3 infjs ... they are definitely the most mysterious of all nfs . i know that the one i know would have preferred a gift card to target instead of a love letter . haha . they are practical in some ways and ... haha ! mine said the same . you're not introverted ! you're so talkative and exciting ! enfjs , if they realize boundaries , can be great . we're complimentary types . but because both types are so ... really ? i've only ever done this for people who i know will really appreciate it ( usually other nfs ) , so i think that is why it's not thought of as creepy . or maybe they do think that ... i know one ... yeah . i got that from him . but i made it clear from the beginning that i was someone who needs space . ha . so i see him on my own time , not vice versa . it's a good way for our friendship to work . but ... shang from mulan ... legolas from lotr ... also zuko from avatar . ha . guys have frequently mistaken my curiosity with them as me liking them . i have a problem with staring o . o into your soul while speaking to you , and i will ask a lot of personal questions right off ... for me , it would also be enfps . we get along wonderfully , and can see the world very similarly , however , it seemed that what we valued always was different . for instance , enfps ( or at least mine ) ... my own personal dream would be to publish a book . it's a small dream , but one i've had for as long as i can remember . the funny thing is , i've not finished a book yet to get published . i'm just ... hahaha ... well , if this chick had any self-esteem i think you guys did what you could to pound it out of her . i didn't see her respond much , which means she didn't expect the onslaught of harsh ... reading this is the weirdest thing ever . lol . i have never viewed giving gifts as some sort of way to get the person you're giving it to , to have some sort of obligation to you . that is so foreign to ... that was just the right amount of cheesy ! <3 that is how i have been living for 19 years . lookin ' sharp ! welcome to pc ! my niece and i say hello :) 176642 '
