' it's not really story worthy , i think . or i can't pick out any that stand out to me but it's usually little things and references to inside jokes whenever i do something . like nowadays , because of ... mpreg ? ! what do you take me for ? ! some cheap furry drawing pervert ! i'm not a freakin animal ! the nerve of some people ! xd the last quote is just ... yeah . i'd say it was an intp thing for weird little comments like that but i wouldn't wanna the deface the rest of them . they all make jokes about us being into ... i think maybe i need better people in my life . i know but i was talking to others and listening to other people and they said that their thoughts just are they don't think in dialogue or monologue and i know that some people in fact also think in ... i'm guessing thats a lot easier when you don't harbour resentments . speaking of - what do you do with negative feelings ? when someone does something to offend you slights or whatnot ? by all means if you must , the internet is nothing if not a safe haven for venting ( pfffttt ) but okay right , then how do you do being nice ? like is it easy to be nice to people who you may not feel ... you and your ... face . and your ' tolerance ' of people . we all know you hate them we all know you think you're better than us smug bastards . infj you make me sick with your internet cuddles and cordial ways of dealing with people and your enthusiasm for life . why cant you be miserable like everyone else ! dont you know life is meaningless ! ? you ... i still think fully formed coherent sentences . does anyone else do that or am i stuck in some juvenile phase or something ? do kids even do this ? warning : co-dependant behaviour and depressing mood swings may occur . possible side effects of bipolar tendancies - citation needed . approach with cool collected outlook . i like men . with penises . i make exceptions sometimes but i prefer the real thing . plus the testicles . i like those too . my f and t functions are borderline , i don't mind men who are more ... someone pleads with you not to murder their family - or to at least spare the children . on their knees covered in the splattered brains of their parents . then you pull the trigger anyway . how do you deal with people you don't dislike ? i take it that you don't often find someone who turns you into a seething ball of pure hatred very often but when you do how do you deal ? if you're nice ... quite absurd , surrealist humor - maybe crossing into the ' love it ' or ' hate it ' category . puns , meh , not so much . i also like putting the adverb aggressively in the most inappropriate places . ... this , and maybe entj , basically the extroverted types a hug button ! ? ugh , what so you could wrap those peverse touchy feely tetacly things around people ! ? uh , i bet youre a feeler aren't you - oh wait even worse ! an ef ! ugh , you freaks and your ... i hope you guys arent actually taking me seriously now . xd it's a naga oh , i am slain ! - polonius , from hamlet . i mean , come on , captain obvious much . my n and s and t and f were all marginal differences 175330 what do you think ? i know , i know . the shading along the tail just looks so smooth , and you can really tell the detail i put into the eyes . i'm amazing . talented , gifted . i've heard it ... i'm too repressive and it makes me hate the ones i love , how do i do the ' honest self expression ' thing again ? best ? all the subjects are my best subjects . i'm just that freaking awesome . i use to be an infp , and back when i was i was an avid anime fan , not so much now but i keep up with one or two serieseseses , i dont tell people what i really think of them , i just make it obvious with gestures and facial expressions . but if they were to say i guess you dont like me i would either not say anything or ... i draw , not as much as i use to , 172114  1721 2217213 0 i don't believe in god either , i don't know if he exists but i don't believe he does , agnostic atheist . really ? only 15 % ! ? dude , that is more than manageable ! if it's obviously communication issues , then yes , you need to let her know your feelings , like , nrghurgherughsrkfhr come on , pull that ... it is , at least thats also what i found out . why not both ! ? i think it's a nature thing - it occurs in nature anyway and from what i've seen lots of heterosexual parents raise gay children so what would be influencing it ? ya know ? if it's ... that . that too . 5w4 , oh the four , so . much . four . it's cringey just reading it . * anarcho-capitalism , i kind of like it , the idea is nice and i would like to see it in reality . i'm hopeful but i can understand how it's flawed . * i think women breed violence without knowing so , ... no , i suck at that kinda thing , but my s / n and t / f are only by marginal differences . honestly ? not really , you're both kinda flaky , your introvert-ness ( thing ) coupled with your fs mean you two are probably going to focused on your own internal feelings rather than the other and one ... sometimes , following your heart is just the best thing to do . yes , i still do it sometimes , like why do we have pubic hair ? why do humans have soft fatty buttocks ? it is satisfying to find out an infp is it ? you again , with you're feelings , you sure you want to be on here ? what if we offend your feels ?
