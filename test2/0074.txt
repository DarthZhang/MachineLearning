' so i'm a female intj who recently came across a male intj who i found massively attractive to me . this is a first for me since i've never been attracted to someone with the same personality type as ... jealousy is the most infuriating thing . so are feelings . alrighty , so here goes . my cousin is an enfp , and although we've been friends for a long time , last october we argued ( again ) and he hasn't talked to me since . we've argued before , but always made up ... i'm wondering why my person won't message me . which is ridiculous to my rational mind because i know he isn't allowed to ... it just makes me * feel * neglected and unloved . which once again i shouldn't ... aha , you sound like my intj father . he said well , you know how it feels , i'm just better at everything than everyone else . ( he was just telling the truth ) hmm ... this post made me think ... particularly about why i make art . i concluded that its because when i'm playing an instrument or working on an artistic project it takes my entire attention and i'm ... poetry and music are almost the only things that can make me cry . i particularly love emily dickenson . i've tried writing poetry but haven't stuck at it long enough to actually find a good ... i can play the piano and ukelele ... i started to learn the violin when i was younger by my parents couldn't handle the screeching .. heh i was about to ask about that ! love the picture by the way . :) it takes talent to take a good picture . i'd know . i am absolutely terrible at taking pictures . i try so hard but always seem to fail ... that is art .. my definition of art is incredibly loose and subjective in this case .. yes ! i've never been a consistently artistic person , i always go through stages of productivity . i was looking around on the intj forum and was unable to find one that discussed artistic intjs . ( perhaps there is one , i couldn't find it ) the truth is , unlike most intjs i'm not a whiz at math . i ... what about for me ? o . o its gonna be terribly suspicious if both one of those faces again and i write our enfp letters at similar times .. o . o any other advice ? ^ this . :( yes . i talked with him via messaging nonstop for about 5 months and we had brilliant dialogues ... when he told me he loved me i cautiously replied i return it rather than saying i love you too ... my verdict ? that's how i'd go about it for sure ... if i were a guy . all the intj guys i know have been pretty decisive about acting on a crush . bide your time and get to know him a bit , we're ... when inflicting revenge i prefer to inflict emotional pain . screw with someone's emotions and make them wonder if you're doing it or they're in the wrong ... yeah , emotional pain is the best way to ... earth ... its the most solid . i have the exact same friend , literally . one of those faces again and i are cousins and i've been having the same problem .. i eagerly await any replies and suggestions . just keep in mind that i'm an ... well my dad is an intj and mom is an isfj and they're the most romantic and still-in-love couple i know after 32 years of marriage .. this is the truth ^ entirely . completely . accurate . bravo .. ;) you will find them buried in books and lurking in the shadows plotting world dominion .. }: ) by all means experiment on intj girls ! ! they're no doubt experimenting on you already , no joke . i once ... kallie is short for kaleidoscope , i like the way the word sounds when i say it and i want to be a multifaceted always-surprising and colorful person .. like a kaleidoscope . i shortened it to kallie ... hmm .. the one close relationship i've been in with an enfp exploded after a while , but he was a very unusually unhealthy case .. partially because he was convinced he was unhealthy personality-wise . the ... sounds rational and all but for devil's advocate's sake ... hardly very christian . i believe it . you're startlingly similar to my entp but with distinct differences . for instance . you are much more competitive . 8 was very present in your communication , i tend to think that 7 is ... i would agree with you that knowledge is more useful , and it does sound rather high and noble ... but it is what motivates me and i prefer honesty to fabricated answers ( aka lying and manipulation ) . :P ... don't ask you say , boy but that paragraph was quite theatrical . ;) trust is important . it is also devastating to lose . the natural gift of skillful deception is a double edged sword .. i do ... because that was pretty much the face i made ! o . o i acknowledge that even stupid people are important ... especially to use ... i just can't seem to exert myself to please them . i have only so much social energy i guess . i pour myself into the ones i ... i don't know how to pick and choose what to tell you about him to prove his entpness . he , like any of my friends , is a complex character that i know so much about that i can't simplify . i don't seem ... i don't think all rules are subject to change .. there have to be some absolutes . create and sustain a relationship with everyone possible ? ? huh . i'd have said : create and sustain a relationship ... he already keeps them rather loosely ... he's holding on with one hand while groping about with the other . he's not wild enough to snap anywhere that i know of ... too rational . i have similar desires ... for instance . i've never been more content with my father's process than now , and never have i had more reason to be discontent . its because i did explore beyond the ... are you an 8 or do you have an 8 in your tritype ? that sounds more 8ish than entpish to me ... to be fair he did try a different way than the rules the first time through , we even held hands ... hahaha ... feeling types ... i know i would do it . being as stubborn as i am ... and to be honest i do have hope just because he is completely aware of these rules and his own family operates under ... hate you ? faceless internet person , nope ... i'd have to know you to hate you . ;) i might decide to dislike your opinion though . oh trust me ... he's not the cowardly type . i was the coward . i'd better mention this now . my dad ? he's an intj too ... yeah . unbendable father of 6 ( 4 married with children ) , convincing him to let us ... christian : yep restricted from dating until 18 : nope . just ... no dating . its confusing . he's allowed to court me as soon as he is financially independent . its my dad's program and complicated to ... true ... and that is pretty much what i have concluded : what will be will be . but sometimes it is nice to discuss it a bit and get new opinions after months of either ignoring the situation or ... he's 16 . i'm 17 . ( i usually avoid giving my age online and in person merely because people tend to take me less seriously afterward . i understand taking my age into the equation . just please don't ... do you need any additional information to offer advice ? if so , just ask ... i am aware that you all put everything into a relationship , so do i . it worked perfectly while it worked , but unfortunately one thing is more important to me than him and it became an either-or ... * question for entps how loyal would you say you are to a person you fall in love with ? say ... hypothetically that you fell in love with a girl and it was reciprocated but you could not ... my enfp ( male , cousin ) friend left me again . this time most likely for good . that's fine , he was hurting me more than i was helping him . my other enfp ( female ) is too busy to talk to me half of the ... i did initially , but then i realized that if you separate the scientists from the science textsbooks and practicing scientists of various kinds and concentrate on what i believe is really inferred , ... lots of classical for me , but not exclusively ... christian ( reformed presbyterian ) gooey insides . eh . i lasted 17 years thinking i didn't have them until i accidentally fell in love ... and then my parents found out and now i can't see or talk to him . :-/ whoa feelings ! they ... the only way someone can destroy me is to gain my trust and interest and then suddenly and without warning lash out . if there is any warning at all i will pick up on it and back away emotionally , ...
