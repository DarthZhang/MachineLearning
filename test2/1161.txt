' i have no idea if you're into anime but your type and tritype is similar to weed's from ginga densetsu weed . plus , his mbti type is enfj , so that's quite close to infj . anyway , you might not care at ... enneagram : 5w6 results : 35 % intj 17 % infj 16 % istj snowflake minuet ah , i've never being able to perceive those things on rain but that could makes sense . perhaps she's so secretive that this is too hard for me to interpret her intentions / thoughts ... 1 . infp . real talk , healthy infps are the most adorable and tolerant people you'll ever met . the fact they unconditionally accept vulnerability and emotions really encourage me to do the same . 2 ... how about ... spreading the right information ? each individual is born ignorant . if you know something better than they do , then it'd be important to educate them instead of ranting . this is how the ... snowflake minuet how did you manage to type rain ? agree with your typings overall , but i lean toward entj for spirit . balto : isfp 9w8 steele : estp 3w2 jenna : isfj ? ? not sure though 8w9 it sounds more like you have 7 instead of 8 in your tritype . i don't have much information from you so i can totally be wrong . i've been dating an infp for almost 5 years and it's still going pretty well . sure , we have our problems but that only help us grow . i guess infj-infp relationships works if both are mature and ... . hi , montréalais ! i'm from montreal too miss , i shall demonstrate you my respect now , without these valuable lessons , i'd be lost . very true . i was always bothered when some of my girl friends waited for their crush to ask them out . i kept saying that she should take the initiative if she liked him . she did but was very ... melancholic / phlegmatic interesting , i never got melancholic before lostgirl for some reason , you gave me this enfp vibe . i believe your enneagram is possibly 2 . enfp + 2 can look a lot like fe users , that could explain why you relate to fe . 6w7 mmm ... feeling judged isn't really a big deal to me . you're so / sx ? i understand it can be a particular issue for you . personally , i don't really care about what people might think of me , that's not in ... i would not want to change my type , i like it as it is . but if i was forced ... then probably intj or istp . this two type seem to be the closest to my personality i guess . this test is shit honestly , i always score as istp or something else lol . you shouldn't rely on this , it will confuse you even more . i suggest you to take your time studying the cognitive functions ... yeah , i thought the same , i'm not sure this is an accurate description though . bc portrayed sx 4s as if they were dramatically unhealthy all the time ! ugh , honestly , this kind of people piss me off . geonerd i might answer your questions , i'm one of those people who has a traumatic experience but doesn't see it as one haha . i grew up in dysfunctional and abusive family ( well , according ... greye hahaha no , i was just messing around ! serious question : what do you like to do in your free time , and why ? ask me anything detective alright , are you an enfp ? father : istj 8w9 mother : esfj 1w2 sister : estp 3w2 me : infj 5w6 stop acting like you're the mature one stop crying , you're weak ( my father used to tell me this all the time when i was child ) all you do is sitting around doing nothing all day ... also : tomoyo from cardcaptor sakura . she's one of the few realistic fictional infj i've met . this anime isn't really into mystery though . it's more magical / fantasy related . this is a common misconception . being feeler =/ = being comfortable talking about emotional issues . sure , feelers can be quite skilled at this , but that doesn't mean they feel comfortable about it ... just look at my avatar and guess i feel more flawed than anything else lol . and i don't think that's making me special , but just an average human being . type 5 tritype : 584/548 i got intj type 1 orderliness | | 60 % type 2helpfulness | 33 % type 3image awareness 26 % type 4individuality 46 % type ... no problem ! i suggest you to figure out your enneagram type before looking at your tritype though . ( tritypes ' descriptions tend to confuse our understanding even more lol ) krayfish don't put too much faith on this disintegration / integration thing . i've seen too many people getting mistyped because of that , and personally , as a 5w6 , i don't think i relate to the ... i understand , but mbti and enneagram are two different systems . it wouldn't surprise me that you feel like an infp sometimes ( i do feel like an intj because of my enneagram type , but i'm 100 % sure ... krayfish there's a lot of contradictions in your answers , it's kinda hard to type you .  ... which makes me think 6w5 is you core type . 6w5 - 9w ? - 2w ? is my guess . the exception alright , that was very helpful and i still believe you have a 4 and 9 fix . these are big indications that you have 9 in your tritype . however , i'm not sure for your ... the exception my guess would be : 6w5 , 4w5 , 9w1 but i'm not sure of the order praimfaya to me , you sound a lot like 4w5 sx / sp with a 8 - fix . perhaps 4w5 - 8w7 - ? ? ( can't decide between 7w8 or 5w4 ) that's just my two cents . which enneagram type would be more interested in self-improvement ? they want to be the best version of themselves , they want to feel fulfilled with their own person . it's more like an end in itself . ... yeah , makes sense . ohthenovelty yeah , although i don't consider myself social , i really value my solitude like you do ! =P but i can't deny i'd like to help people in some way . ah , i'm such a nerd when it comes ... really ? me too ! and your six letter personality is quite similar to mine ... and we have the same enneagram type ... wow . i got iasrce • anthropologists research , evaluate , and establish public policy concerning the origins of humans ; their physical , social , linguistic , and cultural development ; and their behavior , ... actually , i think i have one dream : living with pets . cats , birds , dogs ... i just need to find myself an apartment ... and money ... and time hahaha . not sure how to answer this question , it's almost like i never dream about anything . perhaps , living into an apartment by myself and being in peace ? yes , i think that's that . no she doesn't . she's still estp because of her cognitive functions . well , i mean , most girls wear make up and dresses although i know not every girl would do that . and no , she doesn't read gossip magazines . i think she's girly to some extent but she doesn't totally ... what do you mean ? is she soft or something ? my sister , who happens to be 3w2 ( estp ) , is kinda feminine but not too hysteric . she's expressive though , it's quite ironic considering that i'm infj and feelers have the reputation to be ...
