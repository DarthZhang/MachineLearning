' i dunno , i mean , where are their egos , lol ? can't type someone with an invisible ego ( or maybe hidden ) . always thought rose seemed like a classic feeling type ( old rose seemed inferior feeling though , lol ) . fe dom ? jack , i'm not sure , probably esfp-ish ( at least the persona ) . i seriously cannot guess well . maybe some kind of feeling type , i don't really know ( maybe fe dom ) ... that's possible , but a person cannot claim a type if this is the case ( they are otherwise existing in a basic mentality - sort of a herd mentality ) . admittedly , most people probably are ( and cannot ... wtf . thinking dominants are the people who pretty much need everything to make sense ( in that case , i play up thinking as a defense , but i don't need it - it's more of a desire in my case , not really ... i tend to find fe types have this issue with reacting from emotion at face value too readily ( and then , they might get accused of being meaner than they are or what have you ) . really , not everyone's ... jung's shadow is most significant - most of type is largely irrelevant to anything that actually motivates a person . i mean , you may get so many archetypes of various types that it's laughable to ... somehow , i doubt the old and young rose actresses are remotely the same type , to be more specific ( gloria stuart and kate winslet ) . sort of shows somehow , imo , which always made me typing the ... kudos to this . i had doubts about college at one low point , but now , it has been a dream come true ! if you look hard enough , you'll find some path or more . ^ ^ i'm willing to bet i'm wrong as well . always thought the actor who played the dad johnny ( james dunn ) was perhaps an intuitive anyhow ... i saw the 1945 film recently ( very good ) . i would sketchily assume that the types go as follows ( jung types ): francie : ni dom ... neely : not sure , maybe si dom ... mom : si dom ? ? ? dad : ne dom ? ? ? ... probably a thinking type . i would guess jung's ti dom or maybe te dom if an extravert . he was a vocal intellectual . definitely not sure , but intuitive strikes me as possible from what i've read about him , generally . probably mostly the kind of people jung would have found untypable , particularly a young child . i mean that's just my hunch ( not that they might not start exhibiting a type or don't have one at ... liquidlight does the neurosis bit you're talking about relate to what jung had to say on transferrence ? i'm not this type , but in general , i have kind of a low tolerance for most stuff ( not type related , other than it might reflect my introversion / subjectivity ) . i tend to like a few things and re-watch ... always thought maggie smith and her character were kind of istj , maybe ( not actually sure about s / n in all honesty ) . her character might be a te dom . she's like the epitome of te > fe - i don't think i would ever mistake her for an fe type . i'm not sure of the actual type , but estj might be possible . i swear it's in the communication style . te types ... it's a reasonable guess , but most of what's being typed about him is his persona . it's annoying how many painfully obvious thinking dominants swear they are feeling types . just saying . i swear i know many irl who think they are feeling types just because they have some volatile ... a lot of people have this mentality in general , thinking or not ( at least the culture stifles feeling a lot so that you get this a lot ) . the first sentence of this is very noticeable imo with t doms ... i thought archie was kind of a te stereotype ( not an over-the-top one , but reinforces inferior fi archetypes ) . seth : enfp maybe fi dom ? isfp was always my intuitive guess ... for like hollywood celebrities , i rarely type the present ones - i think jung put it best that you can't really judge the present . so , you might just see some that stand out , but i dunno , many are ... lol , i tend to doubt most . steve jobs as entp sounds about right imo . not what j / p means in mbti ( nothing conventional ) . but yea , i mean , inferior je types are basically the bad versions of je doms , so most of the shit that gets poured on je doms is probably a ... jung had some very fascinating insights on personality dealing with how there are many people out there who do not have a personality really ( or anything he could qualify as one , geniuses included ) ... i know you didn't , but really , it's people running away with like mr . darcy or some example they read about online and think that that person / character's persona has anything to do with mental ... yea , ethics is not related to type . an ethic is pretty much a construct anyway ( breaking down to individuals ' tendencies , one person's ethic may not even qualify as one to another person ) . being very ... okay , let's shut up with the intj aura stuff , lol . seriously though , there is no aura . people around the internet like to think the deep , serious , and mysterious man / woman is that aura , but no ... i think it's common for j doms and p doms to project a lot of nonsense on each other ( j doms might view p doms as lacking a moral center , while p doms might view j doms as kind of mechanical or ... i'd argue people who share the same perception functions are probably at an advantage with each other in general ( otherwise , with those who emphasize very different ones , you're often going to be ... jung as a tert . ni type seems more and more feasible to me . i mean , the tertiary function is often portrayed by beebe as the person's relief / relaxation function , and considering some of his interests ... i never really understood celine dion as an entp ( i'm not sure about fe for her ... it deserves some kind of explanation anyway , because i might buy thinking type , but it's hard to say ) , sarah ... gravity just coming to him is the epitome of intuition ( not some textbook kind of thinking ) . kind of sometimes . it's either some like me ( but find me kind of impossible to deal with on my own terms ) , or some really do not hesitate to subtly show that they want nothing to do with me . and ... depends on what can actually be defined as a conspiracy theory like i destroy life is asking , but for the most part , this is kind of a poorly adapted intuition thing , of the ni flavor ( i doubt ... always thought emma watson was so enfp , it's not even funny ( i've argued that for her a ton on pc ) . always thought elizabeth taylor was like polar opposite of a serious intuitive , along with shirley ... well , i've usually seen her typed as isfp most places ( frankly , that strikes me as more believable than dominant intuitive - she seems to have a more scientifically-oriented , te mode of consciousness ... i would say intj ( intuition dominant - his whole creation of gravity story reeks of ontological intuition ) . he fits the profile as well ( not that that means much , because you'll get tons of so-called ... i mean , i don't think someone like mr . rogers comes off this way . lol , because of bad descriptions that make them look vulnerable for no reason ( i've seen those - the one that claims that these types are misunderstood by their families or whatever ) . this has ... he seemed to think an extreme type meant a pretty black shadow . i mean , he acknowledged that you can get some very ordinary and lazy people who obviously have some messed up shadows ( then again , he ... like , to jung , the real reason a person could claim a type is because they are trying to avoid something else - it's just a characteristic ( more-or-less , no one was a pure type to jung to begin with ) ... well , that's just it - the cognitive preferences don't influence their perceptions of themselves much at all ( i might argue that the inferior influences a person's perception of themselves more than ... from this list , i might only buy hesse ( definitely not salinger - salinger's pretty much every similar fi type's dream author - i mean any kind of fi , not just dominant ) . i think michael landon is probably the only one that strikes me as somehow believable on this list ( i would guess extraverts for a lot of them - i would probably guess sensation types for a lot of ... my guess would be something more thinking-oriented ( intj ?
