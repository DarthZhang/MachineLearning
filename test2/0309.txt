' yea . if you saw my recent response to this thread . exactly . that's what i got from mine also . he was very disruptive and irritating . but , i've finally got him to chill , and let me do my own ... i have been in a relationship with an esfj for 20 years and , i'm an infp . i'll try to sum all that up . the overall emotion of the relationship is comfortable , feel like family , unhappy , secure , ... i just want to say hello again . i've been sooo busy . i've owned my own business , then lost it . also , there are sooo many different things and social sites on the web these days . i've been ... hey . one thing i found out is , you may not actually be interested in your true holland code . your inferior function has a tendency to interfere . it has a subconscious way of wanting to express ... oh no . they don't have the same last name . well . she's in a 3 year relationship that is getting me sick . they do not click at all and , she cries every day telling me how badly he's treating her . she says since her friends moved away , so ... lol . ok . i will . well . no test is perfect , just like no government is perfect . it's a guideline that is more accurate than guessing i would think sort of speek . i forgot to mention what i meant by ideal . ... lol . well . i try to communicate with them in a way they understand better like a different language . but , mostly i believe that life itself forced me to use my thinking more . sometimes i'd rather ... well . i'm infp on both myers-briggs and socionics ( there is an explaintion why ) . one says estp is the best match for me and one says enfj to put it shortly . so , you're saying you tried your ... ok . let me explain as quickly as i can a long story here . i've been into socionics also . i've been trying to convince the estp's we are a dual match and , none of them agreed with that . they all ... are there other kinds of test besides a self test ? how would you take that test ? i took the mbti in college in one of my courses . also . you said needy , clingly to start . what do you mean by to start ? do you mean at the beginning of the relationship , then get cold again ? hmmm . i know an istj-he's pretty cool . yea . i know . i don't have anything to hide , and people can't see personal info on facebook unless they are our friend . but , i already sent the info . how do you delete a message on here ? well for a silly question there sure are a lot of people interested in answering . and , you don't have to read it if you don't want to . so , it must have been somewhat interesting to you to read all ... you hit the nail on the head with that one . it's a feeling of unhappyness , unfufillment , that something missing . sometimes depressing when there are arguments . i'm defidently not saying to throw away a relationship because you're not compatible . i'm not trying to convince others to leave their spouse for sure . but , if you're single , or in a very unhappy ... which theory is the most accurate when it comes to best matches ? mbti or socionics ? my daughter would like to meet a friend on here and get to know . she's and isfp and socionics says you guys would be a good match . you can write her on facebook at heather chaisson in louisiana . ... there is a reason why some people test the same in both test . i wish i would have saved it on my computer . but , therre is an explanation for that . i'd like to know which one is the most ... hi . my daughter would like to meet an enfj to get to know you better . can talk to her on facebook under heather chaisson in louisiana . i told her i'd try to find her a friend on here . she's about ... lol . yea . i suppose it is a little funny . well as far as maturity goes , i'm 39 and dated guys 4 years older than me with a few 20 years older than me . they were mature , just didn't click right ... well . i've been studying a lot of this stuff over the years . i'm 39 and never seem to get it right . the mbti does make a huge difference . at least you can understand each other more . once you ... yea . i see that too . it's comfortable , but the spiritual part is missing ( the n ) . thanks wow ! i wasn't rejected lol . great ! i was just wondering if you agree with the myers briggs saying that enfj's and infp's are ideal ? i've never met anyone like you before . that's why i'm on here ... hey . maybe you can help me . myers briggs says the ideal person for us in enfj secondly esfj . i've been miserable with esfj for 18 years on and off again . socionics says we match with estp ( but it ... ok . here i go again . myers-briggs said infp's ( me ) is best matched with enfj and esfj . i didn't agree with it , because i've been depressed and miserable with an esfj for 18 years . but , myers ... ok . whatever . i just assumed the opposite of love is hate . but , there is in between also . oh nooo way do i want to be hated . i'd rather be ignored lol . the only way i don't care is if i hate ... oh . ok . lol . well . that's good to know and bad to know . since that was my only hope of the best match . mbti was wrong to me , and socionics doesn't look all that promising saying that estp's are ... the myers briggs and socionics doesn't say we are a perfect match , but i love ya'll and i'm an infp lol . just because someone is different doesn't mean you have to hate them . they just look at ... you were 13 ? he must have been real young also . boys usually don't get mature that young . he was still a kid himself . i think maturity had a little something to do with it also . i know some guys ... hmm . i confess i hate to work lol make sure you are not dehydrated . only decafinated beverages would help . what ? it seems you are having problems with people at your house . are you still living with your parents ? i was feeling tired of being rejected and misunderstood by the other forums lol . i need to run back here at home with you sweet understanding infp's like me . i just wish they would have said that ... well , when a person is hurt and another person is more concerned with the person that hurt her and wondering what's in it for me ? seems uncaring and selfish . but , glad to know the truth . glad to ... it obviously hit a nerve for some reason . if it weren't an issue , i don't think it would have bothered you so much-the question . it's just a question . do infp's have the capactity to be logical ? ... lol . it's like the porkipine hugging the cactus that is so sweet . you're trying to point out your point of view which seems a little selfish in some ways to and uncaring , but i have an open mind . i'll try to interpret her point of view differently . when you are ... ok . i see your point of view . i think this is better communication than attacing each other . she attacked all of you which i'm sure she didn't mean . i don't believe all of you are bad guys . it ... well , my mom ( entj ) is bad with names and sometimes faces . everyone knows her . she says , everyone knows me , but i don't recognise them . i feel bad , so sometimes i just say yea yea , i remember ... well . it seems you are judging her for loving this man and wanting to be with him . remember the times you loved a girl and she didn't want you , but you kept going back ? the chase ? don't act like ... yea . they don't mean anything by it . their caring is teaching you something and challenging you . that's how they care . hey guys . i've been writing about this stuff expressing it differently . but , that's a different perspective on it ( feelings ) . yea . the feelings were overwhelming ( i tried keeping it to myself ... yea . that would make me vulnerable to rejection . he may be turned off my my sensitivities , but honestly is the best way to go . so , thanks for your advice . i will do that . wow . ok . there is only one thing that i don't get . if i love someone is because i know them and the dating part is meeting them . i have to date them before i could love them . you said you love ... my mom is an entj and she's the baby of 3 . i know . my mom is like that ( entj ) . of course she used to do hair for a living . she spends lots of time making herself up . she'll ask me , do i have more rouge on one cheek than the other ? etc . ... that's sweet . you know why i asked too , is i fell in love with this wonderful intj type of person and , i told him i love him . he told me he didn't know what love was and has never felt love for ...
