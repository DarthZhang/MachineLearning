' would like carson to be elected , but i don't think he'll make it pass the primaries and he really doesn't have much experience as a politician . he seems like a good man , but at the same time i'm not ... mostly that i need to be alone every once in a while . i just need time to myself and i don't always feel like answering the phone . it stresses me out , sometimes . also , i like to help people but i ... eh ... politics are gross and ugly . but i probably have a conservative leaning in most of my views . i hate the government getting too involved in anything . the only thing i've ever heard about my voice is that it's soft and high - pitched , and i was also told that i have a sweet and pleasant sounding voice . it's a little hard to really say anything based off this information , to be honest . :P if it were me in this situation , it could be either one . but make your interest in him a little more obvious . i ... i think you're okay . i'm the same . i liked loose plans . i like the idea of having a plan even if i don't actually go with it . i don't like it when there's no plan to go off of because i still need ... actually i clean when i'm stressed , too . that or i take a nap . but i typically just focus my mind on one task to distract myself from all the craziness and stress to avoid be overwhelmed . i usually break up and move on when i feel that the relationship doesn't seem to be moving anymore or anywhere . other wise if i think things can work out i still keep trying , but if i see a definite ... i've always been confused about the whole ni and ne thing . tbh . but doesn't ne take in information and create multiple theories ? a person with ni usually just knows things without knowing how and ... i can relate . not sure if any of the solutions that i use would work for you though . i typically either talk it out with a close friend or family member i trust . doing simple things like opening ... lol , i agree . it's a lot easier to do it with other people since it's objective . when it comes to people liking myself , it's not that i don't pick up on things , i'm afraid to assume things . you're ... so , i've been having a lot of experiences where i almost instantly can tell when a person likes someone . i once was watching of my friends interact with this one girl only for like 5 seconds and ... bit late coming in here , but sounds like a troll to me ;) there is no god . pretty strong statement there . but you're entitled to your opinion . i believe in god , but if i were to think about his ... a few things : - insensitivity - taking too long to make a simple decision like picking an outfit or ordering food , etc . - constantly interrupt us when we're trying to talk or if someone else is ... well , i don't mind if someone cries girl or boy , generally . depending on what kind of person they are either i'll give them space or ask if they'd want a shoulder to cry on . but i don't really care ... q1 ) a villain has tied five people to a train track , and you know that a train will be arriving shortly , killing the five people . as you watch , you realize that , if you were to push the villain onto ... i was wondering . so , my best friend took the myer-briggs test and got isfp . my friend has a somewhat of a fiery temper and tends to hold grudges against those who've wronged her . is that just my ... well , i don't think it's a bad thing that you're worried about a coworker . just make sure you know all the facts first , though . can't tell you how many times i involved myself in something only to ... hmm . probably , depression . i've struggled with depression off and on in my life , but it got way worse when i enter college . depression is crippling . it makes you lose pleasure in the things you ... yeah , i'm not really sure what it is either . :P i'm told a lot by people that i'm cute or adorable . i'm not fully aware of what makes them think that way . perhaps i just give off that vibe of ... i'm curious . i have someone i like right now , who is mostly probably an infp . i don't really know his feelings towards me , though he did ask me on date , but it's more like one of those let's have ... i'm wondering . do any of you have problems with motivating yourself when you're given a task to do and there's some sort of external benefit or punishment , and your motivation turns off ? for example , ... i don't really believe in soulmates . granted there are people who you are more or less compatible with , but i don't think there is one person who is absolutely perfect for you and was meant for you ... eh . :P i think it depends on the individual , though . i met some feminists that are civil and have good points , but not many . i think as a whole the 3rd wave feminist movement is a bit corrupted and ... every type has their perks and downfalls . i'm okay with the way i am . just make the most of what i am and not worry about what i'm not . :P why add on to the stress i already have ? that's what i think ... i'd say i'm probably a 7 . i've been told by a lot of people that i'm pretty by both guys and girls , but i'm not one of those people that people put in the effort to get to know or anything . i'm not ... what is your stance on war ?

because they want the better good for everyone . i think it ... i'm not so sure that i like people easily . i can feel kind of indifferent towards most people . but i have a habit of paying attention to people's good points more often than their bad . i'm not blind ... i have a friend who's dad ( when he was young ) was a dating a girl who originally lived in another country . she was feeling homesick and she was having a lot of problems with her family back home ...
