a house built on bologna will be easily knocked down . how about not . also an esfp he's more es andf than i am though . wouldn't it just be better to do individual income though ? not only might there be more significant differences , it would also be more accurate as it is rarely the case that two people in a house ... one thing about okcupid , i took two official mbti tests on there ... the long one and the short one . one gave me istp , the other gave me entp , neither were correct . so , i don't know how they come ... i think there might be just a hint of jealousy driving this . http://baboof.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/ESFP.355231046_std.jpg http://www.enfpforum.com/enfpforum/Portals/0/MBTI%20Pics/ESFP/ESFP%20relationships.jpg the income graph is a little deceptive in the way it was constructed , it seems as though they are trying to make mountains out fo mole hills here because there aren't in fact enough significant ... i walk fast because i like to walk fast , my steps are pretty big but they themselves aren't particularly hurried . i have long legs for my height , this might be the reason , everyone always tells me ... reign it in cowboy slow down turbo take it easy i would be interested in this . i am gmt - 8 . 1 : what's your mbti type ?
