' good luck ! amen . i didn't like the concept of being one of those weird psychic people . you know those guys . freaks , the lot of them . i liked being logical and grounded and not overly emotional and clearly infjs are ... an infj could be equally well-suited in either . however , neither job is a paragon of glamour . expect both to require lots of work and many days of being unappreciated . if you'd rather be directing ... the one thing i have found , even as a solid infj myself , is that the people i try to type infj rarely if ever are and the ones that end up being infj are people i typed something else . yep ... i certainly hope you're right . welcome , unknowninfj . i'm a 6w5 as well . the heightened ti serves me very well in my line of work . this sounds like something that's injured his self-image quite badly . without knowing the details ( not asking for them , mind you , if it's something highly sensitive ) , i * can * intuit that his retreat ... welcome , lerena . enfjs love being spied upon . ;) welcome . tell us a bit more about yourself . welcome . dig the username . it's more like we're not keen on manufactured pathos . :P infjdreamer , the letter is fine . however , if you don't get a reasonably quick response from him ( and by reasonable i wouldn't sit on this longer than a week or so ) , cut your losses as chocolat ... then , unfortunately , he sounds like a pretty good guy . sorry . :P depending on how secure or counterphobic he is , you may be exactly right about that . he's also likely to be less open , even with you , if he thinks you're not going to receive what he has to say ... it's also helpful to remember you can become good at drawing lines artfully , even if you never feel good about doing so . it's just something that has to be done . i've known two , both women . the bingo is when they mention emotional transference , which is the hallmark . as someone in a related field ... yup . to say nothing of the ethical issues of him dating a current client . it helps to realize that , despite the p , ips are inherently judgers ( and the converse is true for ijs ) . drenth has a nice article on this : rethinking judging & perceiving in ips & ijs i think the letter idea is probably the best one possible under the circumstances as well . it might still be too much for him , but i think you have the greatest chance with it . i'd phrase it exactly ... to your specific questions : i think that's unique to the person . however , let's also be candid that the risk to him is much greater than the risk to you . he doesn't know you're not going to ... i think these are two separate things : - i don't like opening up to people on topics that are important to me if i feel they won't treat them with the appropriate level of gravity . as a result , i ... i have this foot twitch , especially when i'm trying to think fast . as an infj currently in a committed relationship with another infj , he definitely likes you , or at least has a non-casual interest . however , i also empathise with his position . in my line of work , ... pointed question : are you sure you're an enfj ? i'm in a committed relationship with another infj , myself . there are strong elements of what you're describing in ours . quite . unfortunately little that can be done about it now , and that risk of hurt and embarrassment just increases the longer the engagement lasts . that doesn't make it any easier , no doubt , but it ... it was less seeing the ti than it was seeing the other attributes . like most , if not all , infjs , i've always been susceptible to emotional transference ( i . e . , ni-fe ); i knew what others were feeling ... i've learned to set those kinds of boundaries , and not weasel by allowing them to negotiate me down , but i still don't like doing it and i don't think i ever will . quite possibly the worst movie i've seen in my life was meet the parents . my friends enjoyed it . i spent most of it mortified under my seat . this is a bit of an oversimplification , but i think it does get the basic notion . for a number of years i mistyped as an intj , largely because i have a strong ti ( i work in a highly technical ... i don't think there's an easy way you can end this , only simple ones . no matter what you do , you'll end up breaking his heart and feeling badly about it . if i were on the receiving end , and trying ... i find that we infjs end up being a sympathetic ear more often than we'd like simply because it's so hard for us to turn away folks who are hurting . unfortunately then we end up being garbage ... welcome . i won't hold the gti against you . ;) i enjoy older series . ones particularly high on my list are maison ikkoku ( my avatar ) , kimagure orange road , macross , ranma 1/2 , neon genesis evangelion , urusei yatsura , you're under arrest ! , ... welcome . awareness of someone else's feelings or wants does not equal social intelligence . i can't control my awareness of what's around me ( i can try to ignore it , but it's there ) . the social intelligence ... professional doctorate . i don't think i could say it much better than lad did . welcome . don't worry , only mr . cafebot bites . welcome . i empathize with your story , because i believed i was intj for the longest time . and thumbs up on the metroid avatar . why bioware , particularly ? welcome . i empathize with your story , because i believed i was intj for the longest time . and thumbs up on the metroid avatar . why bioware , particularly ? welcome . what sort of cat ? i think a lot of boys would be classified as hyperactive now ( i consider that to be a very bad thing ) . i know i would have been , but i had a number of teachers who instead of booting me off for a ... since you asked : godai from maison ikkoku , one of my favourite series . i'd compare it favourably to kimagure orange road , which is also a favourite of mine . can i ask what's so magical about 20 and no serious relationships ? welcome ( back ) . welcome . your english is clearly good enough . :) speaking as a male infj , the most troublesome shoals i've run aground on were ( in retrospect ) infps . this isn't to say the love of my life couldn't be an infp , but i'm just playing probabilities ... for me , if i don't know if we have much common ground , i'll be more reticent to speak about them . it's a piece of me that i'd worry would not be well-received . this would extend to obvious things ... i think i'd be terrified to date another infj . i'd wonder just how deep into each other's souls we'd gaze . that could be the kind of searing scrutiny a relationship could not bear .
