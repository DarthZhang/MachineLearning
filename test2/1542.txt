' eh , i got infj and i'm an entp . needs work , but i can see why it would've said that for me lol . i think the ni and ne statements were really similar so i clicked strongly agree for just about all ... so i , an entp , have recently started dating a guy ( about 2 months now ) and i introduced him to mbti and i told him i thought he was an entj , and he said he thinks he's an i not an e . i brushed it ... seven . freaky as hell but i loved it ! ! thanks ! this is very helpful . also , i just got a mutual friend of ours to introduce me to him later this week . a more direct approach ;) you sound very infp . i'm getting that vibe from just about everything you said . ah . well ... wouldn't it be weird if i suddenly just asked him out even though we've only talked once--and months ago ? i'd like to get to know him more first . and that's what i mean about popping up ... infp heyyy guys so i have a few questions . background : i met an entj a few months ago and we seemed to hit it off pretty fast . i was with my infp boyfriend at the time , so i didn't think of him ... - - or in a long term relationship with , i suppose . what types are best for us entps long term , in your opinion ? i'd just like to know what types you all get along with best in the long run , as i am ... yeah i should mention that that's just our thing . that intp and i have known each other for years and we're pretty used to each other's weird ne-ti thoughts being vocalized . haha , yeah i bet so ! i ... haha actually i went through phases of intp and even isfj behavior until i was about 13 . i realized that my mother , an infj , was trying to make me a mini infj and i decided that i was going to be who ... entp . i'm a moderate extrovert according to the actual mbti test but i feel like an introvert pretty often . like this weekend i did very little socializing and instead directed my energy ... riiighhhttt . mhm . that's why he was so excited about it . i do believe i have insulted one ! ! entps + 1 , intjs 0 https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6b/d5/5c/6bd55caa84a7761775c8ba80bdeddc74.jpg http://67.media.tumblr.com/3bc0e2e29360a454d3ef837fc89ee427/tumblr_mu03kn3Zpe1qzewdco1_500.jpg ... aaah i love fixer upper ! ! ! chip reminds me so much of myself ! ! just a little crazier lol . i typed him as estp but entp works , too , i think . also i think she is enfx , but that's just me . your personality type is : entp moderate extraversion : 14/21 clear intuition : 23/26 clear thinking : 19/24 very clear perceiving : 21/22 i find it interesting that most entps here have ... entp and i have never gambled so i wouldn't know haha eh , i just broke up with an infp boyfriend a month ago ... the beginning was very much like you described , but in the last week of the relationship it all kinda fizzed out . and i ended it for various ... this is why i say intjs have a sad sense of humor . it's like the other day , when an intj friend of mine held up a hand like this and asked how many fingers he was holding up : ... just the way she talks . of course i just got here sooo i'm totally capable of being wrong , however , most enfps i've met have similar ways of communicating . also enfps doubt their type a lot , since ... you seem enfp , man also i like your avatar ;D oh , oh and another question : what do you guys like to do on dates ? ? ? first of all , rosequartz , i'm not an intj but , uh , that crush you have at the moment does not sound very intj . - - - also question : is it normal for you guys to take breaks when you like ... i've been told i look like an infj and even act like it at times . but , dude , i'm abrasive and i love to debate and i'm curious to a fault . i'm entp , then , right ? ? / also i wonder if i'm intp ... i agree . isfj is most likely your type . yeah , try keys 2 cognition . also , i think you sound like an inxp for sure , but i'm leaning towards intp . when you said that in stressful situations you become more emotional , i thought of ... i looovvveee talking to intps . you guys are my best friends . you're horrible at texting and being social but you make up for it by being cute and nerdy and randomly asking questions like : what ... for other entps , what do you define as falling in love ? have you ever experienced it ? if so , how'd it turn out ? 1 ) intimacy means being at home with another human being in every sense of the word . being able to talk about whatever i want and have my ideas listened to and even criticized / discussed , no matter ... you know you're an entp when you take an argument too far and only realize the damage you've done hours after it's already too late oh , the infj mask is really amusing . you guys have 0 problems , life is great ! you try to relate to the people around you while simultaneously absorbing their innermost emotions and secrets and ... mbti : entp enneagram : 5w6 hogwart : ravenclaw patronus : ocicat / marsh harrier wand : dogwood wood with a unicorn hair core , 13 Â½ and unyielding flexibility ilvermony : horned serpent is that sarcasm ? 1 ) how are you today ? i'm alright . i've been hanging out all day at home playing overwatch , scrolling through memes , and arguing on this website , but that's about it . 2 ) what are you thinking of ... i had no idea the two were correlated , but alas ! i have been enlightened . infp truly , my avatar gives off such an istp vibe . hm ... isfp . if ghosts are real , and demons are real , are they the same thing ? could a demon leave a ghost ? or is a ghost a demon ... ? enfj http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmd1zkBiEe1qafrh6.gif run away and never look back estp mine's going to be quite easy haha i have to say , all of the intjs i know are total assholes when it comes to communication . in emails and texts , especially , but in person sometimes , too . i think it's like what newmango said , it's ... i think if i asked my enfp friends to stay in touch with me after high school , they would . so i'd say it seems possible that it could work out , especially if you're in love . go for it ! * raises hand * my experience with one , though ... it didn't work out . my so told me he loved me last night ! i feel like a goof for still feeling elated , but i do . aaaand hey , sorry to butt in , but brienne has actually been typed as istj , so if you are isfj , that would make a lot of sense ! game of thrones : brienne of tarth [ istj ] | funky mbti in fiction not an intp , but i'm close to it and this looked fun mother : infj father : estj brother : esfp haven't thought about their enneagram types much , but i'd guess my father is probably an 8 , my ... this made me lol so hard . anyways , welcome to perc . telling your friends how many hours you spend on this site will get you some weird looks , but it's worth it sometimes . we're all nerds here ;) alphaleonis it did , thanks ! though i would like to say that often when i'm in a bad mood , or at a weak point in life , i tend to start thinking about the past and i regret everything . when ...
