' 0 at 29 . can't see why i should keep it a secret . facts are facts . i could have gone either way on the last question ... probably depending on mood . grown up in a mostly christian environment but consider myself agnostic or atheist . if you would compare my views against whatever-religion i would probably be classified as an atheist . i see it ... looking back at last vacation 3 weeks could be too long for me . the last week was not very productive . but i was somewhat injured too ... i feel the same and i blame it on my coworkers . i ... 11 ... not that surprised . didn't work , diplomatic ( balanced results ) but i didn't fill it all out because some settings / questions were so unrealistic i just couldn't pick any of them . taken today a couple of hours ago . http://i1107.photobucket.com/albums/h381/A11ium/1.jpg edit : that is not my real hair color if that matters . depending on the season , i am light brown or there ... i try not to but ... 1 mom , when being to inquisitive 2 people with bad intentions 1 . yes . 2 . to my knowledge , everybody dies , including myself . 3 . hopefully and probably . guessing here ... nurse : allium , you have cancer . ( oh crap ... whatever ) allium : so , what more can you ... games : ... lot of interraction ... that is how i would describe my taste to . and i hate crappy interfaces . as a pc user i am sad to see so many half-assed console ports ( the porting , not the game ) ... what i want i buy for myself . the things i want are too expensive for anyone to give to me as a gift . and do anyone know what those are ? next christmas i will get myself a new bike , it is actually ... someone needs to drink more water , and some fiber . * allium puts on his coat and glasses * any idea why i usually score much higher s than n in other tests ? leap ? still skeptical . yes , nt-sp . minimal spill on chart-the-course and in-charge . scoring in # pins talent tactical 21 logistical 10 strategic 20 yes i am unsure . mechanic ? possibly ... i am atm gathering ( and planing ) parts for something i will build later . intp ... as primary and ... isfp as secondary ... right . consider me skeptical . yes , frequently . i do smile though , if i like you and to my own thoughts . natural but my twin ( nf ) couldn't make it through the cords so she did it the other way . have been in love but didn't / still don't know if it was mutual . no vote cast . personally i don't think i own anyone , in a social context . i can't see how i as a silent bystander can own anyone . perhaps you are seeing things that aren't there ? rafaelenvoy : finally a ... just came home from a trip last week . it felt great to be free . i don't talk to people anyway so i didn't miss any company . ... hidden agendas ... unexpected . i am going to derail the tread a little . i thought you guys ( girls ) didn't need to hide things . i understand you can't share them but maybe explain why you have ... i can imagine you to sleepwa ... work . awesome ! seriously , i believe so . i think mine is showing me my true unregulated wish ( hidden there somewhere ) as unlikely opportunities presenting them self , ... thanks for that one . now i may understand myself better why i feel i need to do it my way . you may not be an istp but that was a good post on this matter , in my eyes anyway . and only 21 ... siblings ? could you do this keys 2 cognition - cognitive processes ? who answers the questions doesn't matter much to me . how is more important . what i don't like is that she is phrasing it like it is the truth . what she ( vel ) think is suddenly how it is and there are ... i may ( did you notice may ? ) know a female intp . she is ... well ... could be dependable is she wasn't so extremely lazy . with that one you sure are going to pull most of the weight at home and at work ... , not everyone is like you and will feel like you do in whatever situation you are fantasizing about . what i mean is , your opinions are not facts so don't word them like that . this has already ... books , almost never , when i do it is nonfiction . i do not want to experience another persons fantasy . i feel trapped and can not connect to the people involved . it is frustrating being locked down ... i would say i ignore unimportant peoples names , that is why i don't remember them . i will actually forget it in just one sentence while we still are speaking . i would guess my hearing memory is more ... don't think so ... and i thought this was a sign of me being unhealthy ( n ? ) , glad it is common . meaningless small talks and hugs . it is a torture and is a challenge to my patience . my own world is the only way out . sounds like me . i currently have tons of data about a new possible bike ( no motor ) that i have been researching since summer . will probably cost ~ $ 15000 . that is not a typo . btw . why that nick ? ... a swear word may be heard , i think of more than i say though . my general speed increases and i get sloppy . i will be even less talkative than before , mostly giving very short political incorrect ... i'm taken but fine , not upset . you certainly made me see something i usually don't . my comment was to try to show i care . i leave when i lose interest , don't worry about me . looks like a common trait for ists . my fe is weakest of all . yes , it get place 8 of 8 . this is one of those test results if you can believe in them . extraverted sensing ( se ) * * * ( 29.3 ) average use ... niss , not only do you save me at work but my life too ! : happy : i thought the enfps , liked us ... not we them . so certainly individual taste ... no absolutely , i'm not like the rest . to you kel 28 , someone less f ? wow , there's a lot of depressing things to read here . : sad : maybe i should jump from a bridge , who's catching ? : wink : if i were evil i would say this ... bluefaerie , you're off my team ! and i have a hard time with sudden hugs from random people . ... but since i'm not i will say this much more constructive instead . ... i got an intp brother that got some skills with computers . we have both been into it although his programming skills is greater than mine . my stuff i do for a reason , there is something that needs to ... yup , thats the stuff i played with as a kid . now i play with more expensive toys . , yes . but apparently not enough . reading a description now ... i say i use si more than se ... and ti more than te . but i can't be tisi / siti . the dominant and auxiliary can't both be ... are we talking about the thing from denmark aimed at kids ? plastic parts with electrical components and motors ? or something similar ? those space ships are included , if they are model toys . i ... i will be political incorrect on this one ( i am a ' t ' after all ) . to me , honestly , you seam slow . at least with tactile stuff . and it surprises me people say that's just how it is . is the diff . so big ... that made me laugh ! blend ? i am too lazy to blend . as others say , the less i need to touch the food the better . you don't mix ice cream and milk , that's work . you eat ice cream and drink milk ... at first when i first read about it i quickly narrowed it down to i_t _ by reading the descriptions . now ? i am still not sure . mean just to be mean ? doesn't sound right to me . the results seem to ... so far i have only been in one team that didn't suck , that i can remember . well the individuals didn't suck anyway . teamwork is not my thing and as the op . said . surprisingly enough , i feel i have to ... yes but i take care not to put others ( civilians ) at risk . you should never endanger others . i also did an operation on my pmp . fixed the extremely scratched and dirty screen by tearing it down ...
