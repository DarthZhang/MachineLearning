( sorry if i'm blunt , i'm just trying to help a lot of people ... are you sure this isn't his normal phase and he's not just accepted you into the comfortable side of his life ? immediately that tells me he's got some self-esteem issues . this kind of explains ... i feel like i know this girl . i've never done something like this before but i've had this happen to me . i think she was an ntp . came with all the same kind of signs . she was touchy feely , definitely ... i'mma italian / black with some british white in me too . i'm like tan . perceivably more the colour of a fair skinned indian . i find it interesting how so many can't deal with fe or ti . i find them the most effortless functions to emulate . i say emulate because i don't use them probably just see how i can manipulate my ... sometimes i think that people kind of judge your race based on who you hang out with or are presently surrounded by or based on your hobbies / attitude ... like someone once asked me if my ex and i were ... i'm really good at saving . i think i always have been . mum taught me well , not to buy things unless i really have to . sometimes said things are toys , expensive holidays and just things to make me ... do you ever find whoever is closest in your life influences your weaker / shadow funtion use ? i mean , i guess this is kind of obvious ... i'm just kind of realising when i was with an infj i could ... yes , i would , but if you catch me there alone then i'm probably sorting through some serious fi-time and not the most approachable . :P i mean how don't people recognise that ? i dunno where you're from but if you were in london that should be obvious , considering over there when we say asian we mean pakistani / indian . and you ... well i like the sound of that ! mostly ' cause i hate coffee ... but i'm yet to get an invitation to these secret meetings ... ( * cough * sylvirfoxx help a brother out ? ) you're an infj with a history with enfps , you should have known already enfps love that about you . :P dude , you realise that someone has gotta be dominant in a gay relationship otherwise there's no such thing as being a submissive gay ? if all gay / bi guys were submissive then technically no one would ... they are everywhere ! i always know at least one enfp wherever i go . maybe ne just attracts ne to me . like how i suspect ni-doms gather in herds . there's no real place to find where all the enfps ... i dunno ? stroke of luck ? magic ? manipulation ? i've asked him and he just sort of shrugs like it's no big deal and just says i dunno , i'm just not interested in going back to that lifestyle . ... not an entp , but i can speak on behalf of my entp . that's kind of the position i found him in , insisting on polyamory and never once keeping a partner down for more than a few months ... somehow i ... damn , i wish my memory was even half as good ! i could only remember things i learnt for so long ... both my entp and my intp dad like to spew knowledge like that though ... i pose a random question and ... that's what i mean about science-fantasy over sci-fi . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb5bNC8qMJQ you have to be really good at lying to yourself . you have to play pretend that you aren't cynical or suffering first . convince yourself to forget about that and focus on what is now or what could ... that's pretty much the same for me though . i've been on two like full on this is 100 % a date experience and they were so uncomfortable . these were with people i had known for ages and yet ... too early in the morning to try and respond to your long message with 80s reference i'm gonna have to look up ! xd as for this ... maybe ? i think there's less chemistry between me and enfps . i ... if it makes you feel any better most of the people in my life that i idolise are all ntps . and yeah , i'm sure a lot of these writers are mistyped . we know nothing for sure about william ... you are starting to sound like my best mate ( who's also an enfp ) . he loves the science of stars , space-dust whatever ( look , i'm not going to pretend i'm enough of a nerd to talk about it with any ... mm , he's recently been mentioning his father recently . someone who he had no connection with besides what he refers to as a few moments of bad parenting ( offering your teenage son free drugs i guess ... i was hesitant to say depression ... i don't think he's there yet but if he keeps continuing down this road then , yeah , that's where he's going to end up . at least is high functioning depression . i ... i prefer science-fantasy mostly doesn't mean that some of my favorite films / tv don't fall under sci-fi ... kinda cool imagining where our world could be thanks to certainly technology . definitely ... self-healing , growth , a chance to rediscover myself when i thought i'd lost him . overall , i think it helped . teenage years : pride university years : lust now : sloth and envy least ... once you meet an enfp that can get their shit together you will know what a healthy enfp and infj match can look like . problem being the troublemaker is that that technically means no one is our ... sounds familiar i guess . he doesn't open up to me about his problems and it worried me but i think more importantly he doesn't open up to himself about those issues . his childhood probably didn't ... also something i came to learn : if you are trying to work out if you think before you speak and you're not sure that's probably because you can't think of the times you were debating what you say ... do you ever get trapped by si ? i'm just watching my entp partner get more and more miserable . he gets stuck in these situations where he is bored of life but wants to stay close to the familiar , ... hey.its.amanda this is gonna be really tough for you . if he's repeatedly telling you that he doesn't want a relationship then he's at least consistant with that , and you have to believe that . even ... madhouse_xoxo did you do it ? https://i.giphy.com/media/m57pbYGPUXc8o/giphy.webp stachan pretty true . you don't know until you've tried ! is kinda one of my mottos . gets me into trouble , sure , also gives me the most amazing memories too . took drugs because of it , sure , but only ... i used to do this ... i think i've ultimately lost that interest in people though ... i'm too self-absorbed since recovery from depression . i most definitely try to show some weirdness to see if ... conkers .
