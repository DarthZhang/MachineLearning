' adroelectro i agree with intelligence , a sense of humor , and similar values . i understand what you mean by you just know . it's just a certain type of connection . what i like is someone who you can ... i try not to idealize a perfect partner in my mind , but i completely and totally do anyway . i just want someone to connect withx 97someone who i can talk to anything about . generally , more introverted ... the heart of life by john mayer . pain throws your heart to the ground . love turns the whole thing around . fear is a friend who's misunderstood , but i know the heart of life is good . yesterday on friday night i went to a concert ! my usual friday night though ? usually staying in , or hanging with family or friends . kyusaku don't worry about what you said , i understand that you were letting your frustration out . i wasn't really offended , i just wanted to tell you that enfjs really do commit , but i see that ... i am an enfj , and my infp boyfriend of a year and two months recently broke up with me . you sound a bit like him ... but i want to tell you that while i see what you meant when you said that infps are ... i have no emotion whatsoever ! thank you thanks , i will try that for sure . i think it will help too . unfortunately i don't live anywhere near a beach , but a bike ride is definitely doable . also i should stop contacting him , right ? he's too ... i wish i had read this earlier . i did not realize that the inferior function is most likely responsible . i so want to help him , to let him know that i am here to talk . but i doubt he will talk to me ... well he has now given me that space . he broke up with me , because he felt that he was going to just hurt me worse than what was already happening . i understand yet i'm completely devastated . as ... the inferior function ... of course ! he was and i guess still is under a huge amount of stress . but unfortunately .. he broke up with me . so there's not much i can do now . he is 17 by the way . need help here , please reply to me ! ! as i mentioned before , my boyfriend is an infp , and i made this thread about a year ago . i had noticed some changes in him . he was more distant , way less ... thank you :) i know ... i completely agree ... so i did this because i have been confused on my personality type . i got istj ... so , enfp ? i was torn between enfj and enfp , i just couldn't figure out which one i am more like . does anyone know if ... well what you explained is exactly what i mean on this thread , nothing offensive or bias . my point in the thread is that maybe n types communicate better with each other and of course the same with ... with all people or just certain ones is the question ? well , i can communicate well with anyone too . i'm talking about nonverbal communication , and how it seems that i do that best with fellow intuitive types . this is something that i have picked up on . i am an intutive type ( either enfp or enfj ) and i feel that i communicate much better with other intuitive types . does anyone else feel this way ? with ... i am lurking because intjs are very interesting and intriguing to me . i have many friends who are intjs , and i think they are cool . intps seem to really think a lot of enfjs . on here , and in real life , at least the one i know of . they tend to think the intp and enfj match is nearly perfect . why is that ... yes , definitely agreed . it's always important not to assume those things . and our reasons are different sometimes and things that are a big deal to me aren't to him and vice versa . it's definitely ... losing people i love , not being able to help , no one listening to me . i also fear drowning , i mean i can get into water , i can swim , but i do fear drowning pretty bad spiders , wasps . with ... ah , i see . infj is what she claims to be . she's a very confusing person i honestly have no clue . i love this thread . i just wanna throw out what's bothering me , i can't keep it in i can't i can't i can't ! ! ! first of all , i have 2 papers to write and i'm worried they're gonna be crappy and i ... it's not your fault why are you sorry ? are you ok ? why does that matter ? don't be so hard on yourself why can't you decide for once ? i have 2 friends and they are an infj girl and an esfp guy . the esfp guy really likes her , and he basically worships the ground she walks on . i don't think she is interested , but it's hard to tell ... ohh it's not that similar ! i did not threaten press any sort of charges , and never said anything hateful to him , i actually cared about him and the whole experience was kind of hard for me . he backed ... oh i know ! reading about infps and enfjs , i said the same thing . i need to get me an infp . then i had this friend take the test again ( he had first scored at intj , because his answers were influenced ... idk , up to you shutting up now i'm sorry i know this backpack has a hole in it , but i can't switch it for a different one because i'd feel bad for it oh , i can't because ( insert terrible ... aww . i'm not an infp but my boyfriend is . he had his first job interview a couple weeks ago at a grocery store . he was super nervous , he actually puked on his way there because he was so nervous . he ... infps are very welcome here ! and yes , it's true ! yes yes yes ! yeah , my boyfriend is too , the guy i described up there :p roud : oh yes , i completely agree ! ! hello everyone ~ i'm an enfj , and i know one infp that i'm aware of , and we get along so well . we understand each other completely , and we could talk for hours and not get tired of each other ... right now at this very minute ... say you will - foreigner no , he is an infp for my current boyfriend and i , this is our second time dating . the first time , we didn't know each other well enough on a deeper level , he was too shy to make the first move , and i felt awkward and ... i have never met a confirmed istp : unsure : i want to someday , they seem cool ! i wonder if we would get along . i tend to get along best with other nf types . like my enfj friend and i can talk forever ... yes , i think this is true ! ! i do that sometimes i think . i am very borderline j / p so that depends on who i'm around . sometimes , if i'm around p's , i'll ( not consciously ) be more j , because i feel ... there are stereotypical enfjs though ! but yes , i totally agree with you too about the energy thing :) i'm an enfj , and i would be pretty annoyed by that too . i don't think i do that . i think , from what i have read on here , enfj guys are different from enfj girls ... yeah , you would think an enfj would understand about flirting and stuff . i do get weirdly jealous when my boyfriend is alone with another girl . only when they are alone though . like if i'm there and ... yes , i am an enfj and i am also kind of shy . but i know i am an extrovert because of where i get my energy . around the right people , i can be outgoing , but sometimes i'm quite reserved . i think it's ... me - enfj brother - very intj father - entj ( p ? ) my father is hard to type . he tested as an entj , with 1 % judging . but i have read about entp and he has many qualities of an entp . he also has entj ... i know one intp that i know of . he pursued me once , and i did turn him down ... i think he's a great friend to have around but he talks so negatively that i find it depressing . after i told him i ... well i do get a sense of guilt that is terrible sometimes , but not to the point of really harming myself , that's just a little too far and very unhealthy ... the guilt that i get is more , like if i ... my guess - entj . i mean , the executive ? haha . he's seems more extroverted than introverted , and a lot of business leaders , entrepreneurs , etc . are entjs ! also , consider entp ...
