i don't know , i tend to like different people for different reasons . i usually have a few favorites that i almost idolize and everyone else are just plain awesome . but , ... only if the third party knows and is okay with it , and even then sometimes maybe not . i think you're playing with fire here . yep , i can definitely agree with you here . not that i recall running into any infps i can identify as such , but i can see how everything you say would take place since that's how we tend to act ... alright , another esfp ! : laughing : shit , i fueled the last party i went to . i can handle this . well so do i ! so , okay ! we can have a huge estp party ! i'll bring the kegs ! the prospect of inciting chaos in the very near future always brightens my complexion . maybe starting a band and a movement of some kind , stirring people up against authoritarianism and striking ... treebob and norway 88estp ftw ! he probably feels trapped in some way , and the deeper we dig the hole for ourselves , the further we fall in . for instance , being overweight probably makes him feel like he can't get started being ... very content , i can adapt to pretty much anything , and yes , emotionally stable for the most part except when lots of things aren't going my way or i'm not in control ... i love being around lots of ... estp ! ! ! hey , nice to see a female estp around here ! especially as there were only two estps here before and both guys . estp girls kick ass ! um , yeah , i've been depressed for awhile . basically ... what ?
