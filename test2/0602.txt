' i had a hard time choosing between self-confidence , self-esteem , healthy relationship , and maintaining a calm , peaceful mind . i went with self-confidence in the end . i understand the humor part perfectly . i'll laugh and laugh at a man's dirty joke , and even join in , while the women around us are all saying , ewww ! gross ! . when i do find women that appreciate ... 1 . isfj 2 . both 3 . questions like these are why quizzes / tests don't yield accurate results . there's no black and white answer . everything comes down to circumstances , and there's always room ... i see entp , too , and was just about to say this exact thing . i'm unsure as to why you posted a type me if you're so confident in your type ? just honestly curious . i definitely don't see isfj in ... isfj loyal , kind , imaginative , hard-working , diplomatic sarcasm fear wisdom i was going to write my own response , but realized that you basically covered everything , haha ! this is pretty spot on for me . i'll add : i'm very bubbly , friendly and outgoing with friends and ... my answer is fairly simple , haha . i test isfj most of the time . plus , after researching si in depth , it seems more than obvious that it's my dominant function . it took me a while to realize that ... it really goes both ways for me . i love to spend time with people who can carry a conversation , since it really helps take the pressure off me to fill any silences . however , i love to talk . if i ... i pretty much always test as isfj , and many have typed me isfj on here . i don't exactly know why , but i can make a good guess . first , my inferior te makes me want to believe that i am organized , ... i used to be really intolerant of them , until i had my own child . now i understand them more , and i feel like i can interact with them more easily , so it's not quite as awkward . but i still can only ... i completely relate to this , and i don't think i ever consciously realized it until i read your post . as a 9w1 , i can't really argue this one . :D unless i'm stressed , i am very friendly and i'm a people pleaser . that being said , i wouldn't describe myself as a hippy , hipster , or really that ... the stress i feel when someone asks , what do you do for fun ? uhhm . well . i read . i ... cross stitch . and ... watch . things ? it always sounds so dull and boring , but man , i enjoy the shit out ... i always test isfj , but the functions of infp / istj always spoke to me , so i always assumed i was one of the two . i think i misunderstood fe for a long time , and i was convinced that i was a fi user ... never intentionally . i may accidentally embarrass someone because i say something without thinking , but if i realize my mistake , i feel extremely guilty . i think a lot of people forget that fe isn't about emotions so much as it is about values , morals and decision-making . here's a list of how i experience fe in myself : i avoid conflict by keeping ... these stereotypes are exactly what kept me from realizing i was an isfj for so long . granted , i'm a people pleaser , a stay-at-home mom , and i forget to take care of myself . but ... that doesn't define ... fdt thank you . you've given me a lot to think about , and i've learned a few things . i appreciate your deductive reasoning in your second post . that helps me tremendously to understand your thought ... no offense at all ! i know when i was trying to self-type , i would have read your post and said to myself that there was no way i was an isfj , because that's all so unlike me , and the post title is ... i think you pretty much nailed it . i struggle with low self-esteem , and i can be incredibly judgmental and critical of certain people . i don't like it , and the guilt happens sometimes right in the ... on the contrary , i've succeeded in being rude to people plenty of times . but i always feel incredibly guilty afterwards and wish i could take it all back . also , my ability to remember exactly ... i have a tendency to be very shy at times , especially if i'm out of my comfort zone . if i'm in a new place meeting new people , i am very quite and will generally wait to have someone address me ... i posted my first type me thread months ago , back when this was all brand new to me and i didn't understand a thing i was talking about . so , here we go again , this time with the entropic ... i decided today to move my home office into another room of the house . not for any logical reason . i'm just excited about the change . my husband's annoyed with me because he doesn't understand why i ... i'm seconding isfj / infp . i mistyped as isfj for a looong time . i see infj tendencies , too , especially this : but the rest of it screams infp to me , especially : the cognitive functions , as mizz said , are really the key . i am an infp who has more balance in my cognitive functions . it's clear that my driving / preferred functions line up with infp , but i also ... husband : estp mom : isfj dad : istj sisters ( different father ): isfj & infp i think . i didn't grow up with them , so this is really just a rough guess . closest friends : 2 isfjs i've just realized ... i'm married to an estp , so this is literally my life . on one hand , i feel safe and protected around him , and i trust him more than anyone else , but on the other ... i feel small , insignificant , and ... you sound a lot like me ( scarily so ) , and i'm an infp . so take from that what you will , lol . : wink : i get infp or isfp from you , too . those are both fi dominant types , and it seems like you have a developed fe , which may be the reason for your confusion . you are probably driven by your internal ... i can't people pretty much any day . i have spouts of confidence and energy , and i feel like i can take on the world . but when those spouts are over , i always dive into reclusiveness and fear of the ... alright , so i'm a 6w5 infp , so i look / act a lot like isfj , but the functions of infp are 100 % all me . so keep that in mind , i guess . 1 . i am a rule follower by nature . i will break rules if given ... no worries . humans will always be human , and reading your responses to each other is somewhat helpful , regardless of my initial drive to avoid the conflict and keep scrolling . : wink : i think you're right , here . this is what i believe causes me to be quite gullible , because i definitely am . ne / ni is a little confusing for me . i feel like ni is more of a big picture way of ... probably even down to me needing to be told that , even when it's probably fairly obvious , right ? : wink : the more research i do , the more i agree with you here . i will say , it's definitely more difficult for me to see the overall purpose past my emotions in person . in the heat of the moment i tend to be more explosive , but only with those i'm closest to ( so ... that's very insightful , and i recognize those patterns in my learning process . it's hard to really see the difference between what i want to believe is true about myself , and what actually is . it started off that way , before i really knew what you were getting at . my immediate reaction was to get defensive , probably due to the wording . i think when people approach me as though i'm not ... i appreciate the insight from both of you . : happy : i see what you're saying ... it's easy to take people's word as gospel when i'm so new to the subject . as i stated before , i have lots of learning to ... this is where i get super confused , because fried eggz argued many of the points made in that post , and had very valid reasoning behind it . i'm afraid i'll never understand the functions at this ... by all means , i'd appreciate your input . i came to this forum for help from people who might have a better understanding of typology than i do . not trying to offend , but this type of response is very ... no need for apologies ! i didn't take it harshly at all , which is actually uncommon for me . : wink : i admittedly need much more knowledge in the cognitive functions before i can truly self type myself , ... the more research i do , the more strongly i feel that ne couldn't possibly be my inferior function , and that it makes much more sense for te to be . i don't identify much with ti . i just don't think ... interesting ! i'll have to look into this . my understanding of the functions is so immature , so i'd love to hear what makes you think i am se and not ne . from the research i've done today , i see ne in ... i definitely don't think i'm ever convinced that life will be exactly what i imagined . i dream for the fun of it , rather than to plan things out with any expectation . obviously , the dreaming can be ... exactly . i plan which grocery store i'll shop at , i find the best neighborhoods , i'll look at homes for rent ( even if we're not moving for months , lol ) ... i get so caught up in the daydream and it's ... another thing to add is in regards to ni / ne . i jump from hobby to hobby , interest to interest , but have a small set of hobbies that i've never strayed from . anytime my husband gets word of a new ... that's the first thing that put infp on my radar , haha ! gosh , i relate to it so much ... the only thing that i didn't agree with is being a master of self-care . i don't sit around eating junk food all ... i may be completely off , but from the research i've done today , is infp a possibility for me ?
