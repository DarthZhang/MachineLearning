' welcome :) i usually withdraw completely or then the cold treatment . welcome . :) infj , intj , entp , isfj send a delivery full of ... to them ;) welcome ! @ treebob sent a pm . i don't even know how to flirt .. hmm ... dishonesty . a dry martini plus company . ♡ justin bieber ♡ try to smile . for me that doesn't , unfortunately , help at all . ps . cute post :') his behavior comes off as very stressed or worried .. he might have some other issues going on in the background . curiosity plus trial and error . infj . infp's too but damn .. i had stages .. but was ready to walk away permanently , too . i wanted to see if there would still have been something worth fighting for . > _ < □ it's called drama . ( not always tho ofc .. ) shame if we are running low on those .. gimme moarr pics :p everything . welcome . my isfp made me smile today . :) congrats for not being an intj . and welcome to perc . :) the visual font effects and the general style of your post made me grin . i am too lazy to read other posts so i may as well ask now . have you done any mbti-tests ? you seem to posses a variety of ... go go 4 ' s ! yes , i think that i do understand them ( the ones i know irl ) at least on some level . well the one i knew wasn't really lazy , actually just unwilling to leave home . he preferred more his home based hobbies than going out . others might have perceived him as lazy and inactive . this thread is very interesting . it's nice when people appreciate it . i've found my own thing years ago and stick to it . i wear contact lenses in that pic . my natural colour is some weird mixture of grey , green and light blue . why can't i have both :/ months of ni-loop about the same issue which just doesn't solve itself . hehe talk about stressed . yes . i like to experience things . should i post again after a year ? maybe i will , here's one but it's already over two years old hehe ... 167937 my closest circle of friends consists of infj , infps , isfps , enfps , isfjs and an extj . that's just cute . it may be because both are intuitive individuals who might enjoy spending ' introvert time ' together and analyze and theorize thingys . congratulations . this sounds very familiar . one of the reasons i'm pretty inactive on fb nowadays . also have the ' bad habit ' of caring about my closest friends by reminding them of a bit healthier lifestyle . depressing . edit : i somehow misread the whole post ! infps yay ^ ^ it may be because of an internet ego boost , insecurity , mistyping or maybe some just relate to the stereotype too well or too blindly . btw these things have most likely been already said but cba to ... common from my experiences . my closest friend is an infx . we have this special .. bond and understand each other without words and complete each other's sentences . sounds like a cliche but we have known for over a decade and ... usually xxfp's . it might get tiring after some time of mindless repetativeness .. usually i just get disappointed . but when i feel that plus hatred .. very rarely though , but that's not nice . things might get a bit .. messy . anyway , the most hurtful things , i tend to never forget . i totally agree with you on the closest friend - part . i d like to have honesty , loyality and freedom of speech in my closests friendships . also the freedom to openly express our thoughts matters . i seek wisdom . you are weird . could you explain that again ? i didn't understand . you talk too fast . atleast the four i know irl , absolutely hate any conflict and try to avoid it by all means . so they withdrawn .
