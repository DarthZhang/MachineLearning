' you're walking down the street and notice that random people are smiling at you , so you smile back ... but can't , ' cause the reason they were smiling at you was because you were smiling at them , and ... couldn't get more enfj than this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpd3raj8xww i can't speak for all enfjs , but my deep thoughts are like precious jewels that i handcrafted and keep in a treasure chest inside my mind . these jewels are my sanctuary and sources of inspiration ... fiction : the dogs of babel by carolyn parkhurst the fountainhead by ayn rand pride and prejudice by jane austen ( guilty pleasure ... ) brave new world by aldous huxley inferno by dante alighieri ... what are some things that you struggle with , and what do you tell yourself to help you get through it and grow as a person ? :) i love hugs , but i won't hug people for that long unless i know them really well . usually it's a quick hello / goodbye hug , but if i really love you and i know i'll miss you , i'll hug you for as long ... i've only found one cure for this feeling , and it's much easier said than done , but it's possible : love without expectations . love for others , not for yourself , but love yourself . love better . love ... i don't have trouble talking about myself when it comes to what i'm doing or how my day went , but i prefer keeping my deeper thoughts and emotions under the surface . oftentimes i'm so emotional that ... you know you're an enfj when you spend more time on other forums than the enfj one , ' cause your friends ' personalities start to become more interesting to read about than your own . thanks for posting this ! i liked that you pointed out that we enfjs tend to look to infjs for help in times of trouble . it's like we instinctively know that infjs ( though perhaps not always typed ) ... - knowing that i'm needed - passion - comfortable silent moments - core values preferably similar , although i love different perspectives on everything else in life--keeps things interesting :) ... yes times a billion . hahaha ! i definitely say it like that in real life . :) sometimes i start to hate the inner voice that says , you should know better . if there's a potential conflict between another person and i , it's my job to understand the other person's point of view ... how do you know if a friend or family member really loves you ? what makes you feel the most loved ? what are your biggest pet peeves ? do you ever feel pressure to be different from who you really are ? if so , in which areas of your life do you feel this pressure ? how often and in what way do you cave in ? do you like talking about the abstract and theoretical or would you rather talk about current events / feelings you're dealing with ? do you ever find yourself tired of talking to nfs when their minds ... as enfjs , how important is personal growth to you ? how do you grow and what happens to you ( emotionally / spiritually ) during the process ? i ask because it's one of the main focuses in my life , and ... what is the real you that you would like people to understand ? just curious ... :) if infps are boring , why in the world does your forum entertain me more than any other ? what does that say about me ? ;) 1 . i am obsessed with quotations . 2 . i put people on pedestals , and i'm trying to break this habit ' cause i've recently discovered how unhealthy it is . 3 . i'll party until about 2am then leave and ... i was just curious ... do isfjs need to be somewhat misunderstood ? the isfj i know has repeatedly said that this was one of her worst fears . if it's one of yours as well , why ? oh gosh , there is such a broad range with istjs . i've only met two , and although the istjs have common characteristics ( task and detail-oriented , perfectionists , driven ) , they were too different to ... what makes you feel most like a failure and how do you deal with it ? for me , it's relationships of any kind that don't meet my impossibly high standards . if i can't make it work the way i want ... yes , i've just recently realized that i was a control freak , but luckily it only comes out when i'm passionate about something . but hey , i'm passionate about a lot of things , so ... haha . since ... you have self-help therapy sessions at the most absurd hours ( thinking time , the painful kind ) , and no one knows about them but you . i care too much . i over-empathize , and it eats away at me ! when people don't come to me for help , sometimes i feel offended . the worst part is ... this is completely illogical . why do i have this need ... very much so . i dated one , actually . :) great guy . i learned that it is the weak who are cruel and that it is the weak who are cruel , and that gentleness is to be expected only from the strong . ~ leo rosten experiencing our familiar rooms and ... you're all alone on a ski lift so you start whistling and subconsciously start swinging . all of a sudden the ski lift stops and you realize what you're doing so you immediately stop the swinging . ski ... haha this is spot on . i'm a black belt , and when people find out , they almost never believe me right away . ;) you're kidding me , you're kidding me , you're kidding me , oh my god ! ! ! this is exactly what i'm doing / how i am ! ! ! i'm in nursing school , but i know i'm a natural teacher . still , i'd rather not go into ... haha awww ! this is cute . :) the last time i saw one of my infp friends , i wasn't expecting to see her , so when i did , i ran , gave her a hug , and literally knocked her down . i had to pull her back up ... i agree with all the other enfjs on this thread--enfjs are literally everywhere . the trick is spotting them , i guess . i think an enfj trademark ( well , with the ones i know ) is that they tend to plan ... ugh , i just love you infps . perc is probably so sick of posts like this too , lol . i bet if they could ban them they would . ;) but really--you guys are the sweetest . haha , i can completely relate with this . it seems like the guys that i think are out of my league are the ones that end up liking me . i was actually just talking to my brother about this . i asked ... oh , no worries , i've wondered about that myself , actually . :) i guess i could be . it's definitely possible . i only scored a little higher on the j scale . i'm a planner though , if that helps . ... haha , ohhh yeah . most definitely . i've ended up on accidental dates so many times , it's embarrassing . also , this is a recurring conversation : guy : so ... what are we ? me : huh ? ... me : ... ok , this bothers me ... i have a sort of people adhd , where i can't spend too much time with one person , no matter how much i like them . sometimes i want so badly to make myself want to talk / be with ... hey hey ! thought i'd make one of these here ( stole it from the infps ) , but yeah ... quotations offer such insight into a person . i'll share some of mine and what d'you say , fellow enfjs ? post ... this is spot on , actually . :) i do like to give often , especially when it's unexpected . i like giving fun , thoughtful gifts . if i get someone something practical , i'll usually add to the gift and ... i'm not sure if the fe helps me read others . i think it's the ni that does that , actually . :) you're so insincere . i've never had anyone say this , but i always fear that someone will . i sometimes think that when i tell people that i love them , they don't believe me because i tell so ... you can brighten someone's day even when you're having the worst day of your life . yes , i can completely relate . sometimes i see people sort of like jewelry in that they all have some kind of shine or glow about them , but some people shine brighter than others . i understand what ... caraez , have you known these enfjs for a long time ? i ask because infps are hardly ever on my radar until they make several attempts to get to know me . even these attempts are so subtle that ... yes , i can definitely relate to this . i'm a creeper to the extreme . like ... i made a google map of where all my friends live so that i can easily find their addresses if i need to send them mail , ... i don't think i'm initially naturally drawn to a particular type of person . when i walk into a party in which i don't know anyone , i start talking to whoever is closest to me . i quickly befriend ... i'm actually very affectionate . i didn't realize it until one of my friends described me as the spastic , touch-feely one , haha . when i see people i like , i can't help but give them a hug ...
