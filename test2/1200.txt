' dear intp , i enjoyed our conversation the other day . esoteric gabbing about the nature of the universe and the idea that every rule and social code being arbitrary constructs created ... dear entj sub , long time no see . sincerely , alpha none of them . all other types hurt in deep existential ways that i want no part of . probably a sliding scale that depends on individual preferences , like everything in humanity . draco malfoy also . i'd say he's either 358 or 368 . i'm either 358 or 385 , though in which stacking to me is a somewhat arbitrary distinction to make as i believe that the core indicates primary motivation and has a hand in every action . therefore , a ... i'm not particularly introverted or extraverted , personally . that said , i would say i'm somewhat unphased by either social interactions or being alone . what i'd say i crave more so than anything is ... dear type 9 infp , your absolute admiration of me is refreshing . you're a great girlfriend and i wish we both didn't have such busy schedules so we could be around one another more often . keep ... 2 % still means about 1/50 people . i've probably seen 1-2 others today . i never understood fascination by virtue of rarity . so , you're on the esfj train also , right ? i have toyed with the idea of the op being an extrovert also for awhile now , actually . after many conversations with him , however i'm disinclined to believe it due to op being much too close with fi ... still esfj i disagree . definite esfj . fe - si all up in this . where have you been ? your mother and i have been worried sick . similar feelings concerning entps . i collect shoes . i do so because i like status and nothing communicates such a thing as much as a pair of jordans . sure . let's get weird . back . off . best ... [ insert other into previous post . ] wow , don't nobody got time fo ' dat ... jk , u kno u mah boi . well , as i'm sure everyone knows , being social primary doesn't necessarily equal being social . i like other people just fine , but lately i've been on a bit of a break when it comes to my ... that's pretty crappy of her . your sex life is definitely not her business . if i were you , i'd definitely talk to her about it . yeah , i had a lot longer to think about it . that said , i don't think you're te , so if we operate under the assumptions in the op , you're infj because nothing else makes sense . i'm not saying i ... whether or not you actually are , your mom makes fun of you for being a virgin ? is this playful teasing ? just stab in the dark here , i don't think that's te under the hood . if this here is all i'm given to work with , i'd have to say infj . compare your idea of ' logic ' to mine : logic is a series of ... what makes the most sense ? tentatively intj . still reading . edit : so far , i am of the belief that you're most of the things you say you are . i appreciate the level of detail . edit : also relatively certain you are ni ... refreshing self with reading about instinctual variants . god , i'm a hard social type . wow ! useful thought you had there ! wanna know what my favorite part was ? the fact that it ended ... i am both annoyed and intrigued by xxfps . as far as i can tell , i dislike all j types in my normal life . i'm not of the mind that any enneatype / mbti combination is impossible because cognition =/ = the things that motivate us . that said , we can clearly observe many types being more common than others ... sx as hell ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U very seriously toying with the idea of being 351 . i can be pretty aggressive and controlling , but i have a massive ' holier than thou ' streak once you get to know me with any depth ( like more than 1-2 ... i'd say it's a mostly emotional experience . because i find in depth study of cognition more interesting . included mbti in my answer to illustrate how much i enjoyed socionics . interpret the post as wholehearted agreement with what she was ... no real argument here . i know what i am , and what i am is an asshole that is , for a second baring his teeth at the people that seemingly have a lot to say but refuse to address me beyond a single ... i would refer you to the op . if you need a literal analysis , i'm happy to provide it . that said , i'm going to assume you're able to read and interpret symbolism , so i doubt you'll need that much help . and this was sort of my thought process . the initial post and how it connects the generally accepted view of the type 3 and what the type 3 is motivated by doesn't seem to be in need of explanation ... oh my ... i am quite crushable , huh ? back atcha . i was , but it's 5am . i'll take what i can get . i wanted to come up with something clever , but it's almost 5am . i would give you a lot of sex . so then why do you even bother asking if you've already made up your mind that you are an extravert , intuitive and feeling ? if you've already decided you are these things and have evidently done the ... wasn't sure i listened to sx music until now . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hcYx_y5xdo infp messaged me with a picture of herself before going to bed . asked me to say goodnight to her . asked me to say goodnight to her again . i did . i thought it was weird , secretly . i like ... either way , you see my point . the actual rarity is skewed and makes a type seem rarer than it likely is in real contexts . i may have been the only one of my type in a class room in high school , but ... wow my math was off ! i literally just said numbers . see how over glorified the type is ? even so , though . i saw around two-hundred people ( really rough estimate ) between both of my jobs . it's ... rarity in the context of the entire planet is somewhat silly . even if we assume the greatest reports of our ' rarity ' , we ( intj ) encompass 1 % of the planet , which sounds rare when you don't think ... one could say that whatever the culmination of all of our actions are throughout our lives equal our potential . in this sense , everybody does , but as we all know , not everyone's potential is the ... i would agree , however , those that profess to know their type not stating anything about their type's motivations strike me as either not wanting to touch on them or not being able to . if they don't ... lol .
