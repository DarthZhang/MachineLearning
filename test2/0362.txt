' the host ' :) i feel like it's so hard to convey the intensity of what i'm feeling through words . do you think we will ever run out of words ? i confess that i have somehow developed immunity to the constant war and pain on my screen . today i felt like moving my heart , so i went to the movies and i cried a whole ticket's worth of tears this is exactly the same for me - because any anger instantaneously turns to sadness . it made me smile when i read this , because my friends always say i'm so peaceful and calm ( even though i don't ... people who don't know me very well see me as very closed , awkward and shy , and quite a few people get the impression that i don't like them - i think it's because i'm so reserved . it's ironic that i ... you're so helpful and lovely . : happy : i wish i had a clone . we would be best friends . recently i've been feeling so frustrated and upset , because whenever i think about what i would like to do at university and for a job , the only thing that comes to mind is writing music . i keep ... when all the beautiful childhood memories make you cry . i hate how in the evening i often feel inspired by my thoughts about humanity and how i should lead my life , but that inspiration dies away so quickly , and the next morning it feels like nothing was ... when you go through the pages of this thread , and find yourself ' thanking ' every one of them , but then get worried that people might think you're being insincere , or just ' thanking ' for the sake of ... when you feel so anxious inside and there's a knot in your stomach , but you have no idea why . thank you so much :) one of my original songs , called ' pyre ' : chirbit - pyre - original song - how_fickle_our_hearts - share audio easily aww haha thank you :) when you feel so deeply connected to other people , but the world still feels far away . when you constantly walk into the shower with various items of clothing on :) i wish that i only needed my own heart to inspire me ; i hate that i need a beautiful song or a sad movie . floating is fun :) despite what a lot of descriptions of infp's say , i'm not very good at consoling other people . i wish i was . my way of handling the situation is usually to hug them tightly , and even though people ... wow , thank you ! :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5B8qMamdt8 ' give a little love ' , by noah and the whale . the majority of my dreams involve swimming pools . chirbit - ' turning page ' by sleeping at last ... - how_fickle_our_hearts - share audio easily i'm a bit confused , i think you need to type it in without the www . sorry if it still doesn't work - ... when i stopped sleeping with my doll , because i felt was getting too old for it , my mum put her in the glass cabinet , but every night i opened the cabinet to say sorry to her and give her a kiss . :) sometimes i have mildly strange dreams , but other times my subconscious decides to go all out with the craziness . i once had such a funny dream , where i dressed up as human-sized egg , and i was ... it is very wonderfully strange :P well , your fingers do taper at the ends , and your thumb seems quite small and elegant , so you do have some characteristics of the ' psychic hand ' . :) i feel very proud of myself at the moment . all day , my parents have been trying to explain to my two brothers that they shouldn't be playing video games all day ( even though it's the holidays ) , and ... when i was about 12 years old , i remember reading a forwarded email with a painfully stereotypical description of someone with aries as their sun sign , and being really upset and confused when it ... 62747do i have a ' psychic hand ' ? i can't really tell . my thumb seems kind of big .
