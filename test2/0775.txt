i think they deserved it . : laughing : i swear one can write anything on this thread and no one other than the regulars would ever read it . they probably think we're such snobs ; either that or they think we're terrible bores . i'm pretty ... you're a classically trained infj violinist goddess ; why on earth would you be jealous of anyone ? this is what's been haunting me for the past few weeks : https://youtu.be/YmYeISiVPOw oh yes , i love winters ! : tongue : that's it , i'm moving to canada ! : laughing : just checked it out ; that stuff has great reviews and is quite inexpensive . these french are bloody thieves . and what would that be , if you don't mind me asking ? what does that even mean ? hmmm , do you have cats ? this one is pretty popular everywhere . tis true ! this is the one my tabbys eat : http://image.11st.my/g/7/4/0/3/7/4/16740374_B_V1.jpg inxj . immature xnfp . tmlt hate cities . why does cat food smell so yummy ? it's back on youtube ! https://youtu.be/83wY_IegKqU spellbound ! thank you for this . i still haven't decided which movement i'm going to listen to while i sit next to our beloved maestro's grave on an early spring morning . perhaps the scene by the brook ? just want to see how it looks from someone else's perspective , that's all . any takers ? come on , i won't bite ! does anyone here think i've been mistyped ? exactly what i thought when xiii said it ! my favourite nocture ; and just when i was about to sit in the garden and listen to the nocturnes while sipping my tea ; it's midnight here . you really surpirse me with your taste for chopin . and after ... trust me , we were made for one another . like a moth to a flame . home ! : blushed : fascinating ! were you previously acquainted with the piece ? he hardly stops leaping around during the first movement . also , he had to conform to the traditions of his time . you have to understand ... well , this is what i wrote on our classical music thread today : and here's the aforementioned video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zpI3NWU6FQ do you think that the adjectives used by ... nihm i would like your opinion on something . i emulate enfps all the time , and i've seen enfps emulate me . for me , emulating an enfp is effortless and fun ; although , i'll eventually drain my batteries . however , in case of my estp father , ... very true ; i'm aware of these impediments . and i assume you meant unfalsifiable ? an enfp who likes chopin , debussy , and tachikovsky ? : confused : and doesn't call the compositions songs ! : shocked : where have you been all my life ? ai.tran . 75 by the way , i'm pakistani ! : kitteh : lol , no . i'm an ex-muslim atheist who doesn't care for religion . although , if i were to choose a group of religious people i like most , it would have to be the jewish people . they don't let their ... you presume wrong , my friend . that is not at all the premise of this thread . and why would you even presume such a thing in the first place when you are well aware that i am as a much a heir of the ... it's yom kippur ; you probably mistyped it . yom means day in hebrew and arabic . vegetarians have the moral high ground , no doubt . question : where do you draw the line , personally ? bach's cello suites ( mine and his ) and saint-saens ' cello concerto ( or is it schumann's ); favourite cello pieces , that is . : kitteh : i'm guessing it's his favourite instrument ; either that or the ... my favourites are : violin , piano , organ , harpsichord , cello , flute and oboe . least favourites : the entire brass section ( don't smack me , gotterdammerung ) . i love the piano ! no one does it ... lately , i've been enamoured of mozart's oboe concerto . when i first heard it , it seemed a bit too derivative . however , upon revisiting it after discovering mbti and ne , the concerto sounds so ... that's it snowflake , you're no longer my favourite person ! gotterdammerung , you're up . pastoral is your least favourite ? blasphemy ! : angry : wow , aren't you mature ; what's with the insults ? there never was a comparision between contemporary africans and scandinavians . : 1892 : gotterdammerung especially when one has blond hair ! xd yes , acting cool around jewish people becomes necessary when one has wagner as their profile picture ! : laughing : i will try to reply tomorrow ; it is quite late here and i am a bit drained . however , your question regarding the correlation between jung's perceiving functions and elman service's classification ... aww , i am so sorry ; that was certainly very inconsiderate of him . * why do you think he's an infj ? * how old is he ? fepa do you think nts are also as picky as nfs about their partners ? lol , yes . : tongue : are you proposing that the sensation types are sexually more active than intuition types ? ugh , i wasn't basing my argument on climate ; rather it was based on this : now , what i am proposing is that since as of late , the human problem-solving approach makes less use of the senses for ... contemporary violinists doing it right ; not a common occurrence for this piece . the heirs of saint petersburg conservatory do not disappoint . https://youtu.be/DJTuVehxoWg snowflake minute ... it has always been my favourite symphony . in my darkest hours , it was always beethoven along with the sentimets i share with him that kept me going . it always startled me how much his music seemed to ... whoa ! https://youtu.be/7jWmdzOxD9s
