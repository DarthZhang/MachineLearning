' it was actually easier for me to tell in terms of fi / fe . i was able to tell that i was an enfp because the feelings that i did feel , i felt extremely strongly and were very personal and often linked ... omg yes exactly hahaha . i definitely admire her for being able to do all the mean things that i would only think about and consider . she's like the embodiment of my darker side ... so relatable :D aww thanks firelink : 3 i definitely need to start coming on here more so we can have more of those discussions ! ! really ? haha i'm glad to hear it ! i had just always heard her typed as an estp , and she seems so pragmatic and to-the-point , moreso than most fictional enfps would be whoops double post somehow i relate to scarlett o'hara in some ways , despite her not seeming very enfpish i tend to be ~ 10 minutes late for events that don't require me to be on time . any more than that seems inconsiderate and i wouldn't do it - if there was a reason why i had to be late i would ... i think the lower level people obsessions can be somewhat cured by just having a breather period away from them and with other interesting people , yeah . that's happened to me a couple times . what's ... i definitely give too much weight to authority figures in my mind . i tend to resent them more behind their backs , but comply more readily to them than anyone else to their faces . which makes sense , ... i think enfps in general tend to be really flexible and just bend , bend , bend ... but there's always a snapping point . and our snaps are terrifying because we've bent so much . i'm like ... 85.7 % positive i'm a 9w8 . i think i'm a bit more reserved than other enfp on the forums seem to be - - i don't post nearly as often and i tend to lurk a lot . i think i read somewhere that ... shoulderbladesss <3 from what i've experienced , it irritates most istps when pointless questions are asked , because the only reason they perceive for the question is some invasion of privacy . which makes sense - ... whenever i communicate , i always tailor my words to suit the audience . so yeah , on forums i tend to give the minimalist answer you know you're an intuitive when you randomly notice a huge blister on your heel , and then realize that you've been subconsciously adjusting your gait for a week because of this aww thank you so much ! somehow i managed to completely miss all these notifications :P but seriously , thank you ! that means so much :) i really respect all the questions that you have and the way ... is an istp interested if they randomly text you after months of silence , when the two of you have no mutual activities and there is no concrete reason to talk ? helping other people - being able to connect with them on a deeper level and have discussions that cannot be had without a set of morals . these always remind me of how good i feel when i am sticking ... one of my best friends is an infj :) she's great . likes : - we can talk about literally anything - we connect on a spiritual and emotional level - we are both accepting of each other's ... if you get really excited when you first see someone ( anyone ) , that's a hint that you're an extrovert - - even if once they start talking you get a little drained . there was a quote i read that was ... yeahhh , i get what you're saying . like thinking about the risk and people's potential reactions that could come from it causes you not to take the risk ? even though the risk isn't necessarily risky ... enfps have a very contradictory nature . we're able to appreciate practicality and idealism , we're capable of caring so much it hurts and two seconds later not feeling anything at all . we see so many ... i think muchaparadox has got it . ( i love that username by the way ! ) enfp really , really dislike feeling obligated to like someone . if someone is trying too hard to get us to like them , nothing could ... haha yes . i always have some innate sense of faith that no matter what i do , things will turn out okay .  ... and they always do . so , you know , it works out nicely . personal stories , funny stories , possible explanations for a third party's behavior , ridiculous ideas and possibilities , feelings , debates as an enfp , i can completely relate to the first half of that scenario . i think other people getting overly attached to enfps that are just trying to help them out , etc . , is probably fairly common ... i agree with all of the above . i do the same thing as your brother . it's not that i don't like my family or don't want to be around them - i just need to introvert when i'm at home . i need ... hahaha i forget to wear shoes out all the time . especially when i'm walking somewhere rather than driving . ain't that the truth oh man . i think istps are so sexy i agree a lot with what pinkrasputin has said . i think that for enfp , when we're with people , we tend to be in the moment . so when she's with you , she's happy and everything seems to be going well ... op , i do the exact same thing . it's either getting awkward and cold and distant and strange and i like the person for forever , or i just develop a little crush and talk a lot around the person and ... you eat an entire slice of pineapple pizza before realizing there was pineapple on it . on january 12th , you realize that the christmas tree is gone and you don't know how or when this happened . haha i relate with the op a lot . i'd usually rather listen to someone else share their story . a lot of the time i'll think of some story and i'll want to share it , but there never seems to be the ... i can focus if everyone around me is focused and it starts off silent - then i get into the zone and i don't even notice loud sounds . the real problem is getting me to start to focus . it's like ... when you look at your friend's sound system on their car , and it says cd 15 , and you accidentally read it upside down as sip ' before realizing that ... you're reading it upside down and it's just ... i don't mind people complaining / venting to me , but there is that line , where the person just whines about issues and never attempts to fix them , that irritates me . i don't really complain to any ... the most horrifying thing for me is how i somehow absentmindedly end up becoming the exact person that everyone in my life needs ... and then i can't stay that person hi i miss you a lot and i don't know why we're wasting our time not doing anything ! ... i really , really miss you . i'm good at english , psychology , philosophy . those all come naturally to me and allow some degree of creativity , at least in my school . plus they're interesting and usually relevant to my thoughts . ... maybe it's just because i'm young , but whenever i'm rejected , i start to doubt myself majorly . even if it's just a perceived rejection . your type : enfp mom's type : isfj dad's type : estp ( ? ) siblings ' type ( s ): intp , estj best friends ' type ( s ): esfp , infj , enfj , intp current / last significant others ' type : infp type ( s ) you have the ... yesss :) like genres of music , but with people . i prefer thinking of it as what genre i am on a particular day , rather than thinking of myself as being an entirely different person . we enfps ... ^ agreed . being around different people and interacting with them inevitably influences you , and different people emphasize different aspects of your personality . i think this is natural , and it's ... hahaaa yes . and then i gesticulate wildly . i'm always friendly , but i don't make any effort to carry on a conversation . i really dislike small talk : s i would recommend asking the enfp to meet in person again , and judging from there :) in my experience , with enfp and infp , there is a notable connection that is clearly felt by both of them while they are together if there is any spark there . if they are together and the same ... i've felt it for istps and sometimes intjs - probably because they frustrate me so much trying to figure them out , and i am forced to throw all of myself in . isfp types tend to gravitate towards ... as most others have said , it really depends . if this was someone i had just been interested in , and it was just that nothing ended up happening , i probably wouldn't be too overtly interested ...
