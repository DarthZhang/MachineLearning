' in my opinion , she gives of a pretty song introverted sensor vibe , so i am thinking sp is wrong . basically , she does not seem to be overly active , overly athletic , or overly in control of her body ... off the top of my head , i am leaning toward entp yeah , i think you may be right - - infp she acts pretty much just like the supposedly infp girl at 2:25 on this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrQex3_2q0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNG093FMers&list=PLA07DEA9D16F9AA02 i have met more than one person who comes across like this . figuring out what this girl is will help me in my quest to type ... i haven't watched that many episodes yet , but i say estp or istp for dean . istj for sam . ( from watching the television show ) stark ned - isfj cat - exfj robb - istj jon snow - istp , possibly isfp brandon - intj sansa - esfj , possibly esfp arya - entp maybe entj he doesn't seem like the world's greatest detective to me , so i would shoot down the opinion above based on that premise . i voted istj based on his mannerisms , zeal for order , and lack of sociability . his wife is way smarter and more logical than him . marckos he's kind of awkward like an intp , but i don't really know . i don't think he's an isfj . fi people can care and protect others as well . you can see his lack of fe with the fact that he is never warm , and is not particularly diplomatic , either . rick : isfp shane : estp . i guess enfj is a good second guess , but he acts like a thinker . andrea : esfj ? dale : entp glenn : entj darrell : esfp maggie : isfj lori : istj carl : estj the ... i actually don't think estp with social anxiety is even strange . extraversion does not refer to being good with people . it refers basically to being active , outgoing ( not necessarily with people ) , ... she struck me as an enfp just from googling her image to see who she was , based on comparison of vibe with an enfp girl i knew . then when i watched a video , i confirmed enfp . entp would be my second ... i vote isfp . the reason people have suggested estp or infj is because a strong fi has a tendency to throw out emotions externally , like an fe-user . also , i think she is too feeley to be an esfp , ... emily thorn ( real amanda ) - - hard to decide , but isfj is my best guess nolan - - entp conrad grayson - - istj victoria grayson - - infj daniel grayson - - esfp charlotte grayson - - esfp amanda ... my problems with pod'lair , not necessarily in order of importance 1 ) their names for the functions are idiotic . 2 ) they completely rip off jung , while giving him virtually no credit . 3 ) ... rick - isfp shane - estp lori - istj carl - estj darryl - esfp glenn - entj andrea - esfj ? dale - entp t-dog - intp carol - isfp this girl is not me . but it is good to see agreement . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqEnn65hu5U i am thinking esfp . for a while i was tempted to say fe and estp , but i have decided otherwise . can anyone confirm ? sparky major fail on this one owfin , so she trusts in things that are not actually facts , but that she accepts as facts . hmm ... , so everything printed in a book is fact ? and i did not say what you quoted regarding perfectionism . that is somewhat dishonest to misquote me . that's because she is a dominant thinker . that doesn't actually have much to do with being an istj . how come she is the only one who figures it out and believes it ? but death of the author is the correct way to analyze . otherwise we wind up with idiotic things like gay dumbledores and such , that are not actually mentioned in the text whatsoever . istjs ... i think entp is incorrect . seems to have fi . not really . that's what the teleprompter is for . i don't know if this has been suggested yet , and i don't want to read through 27 pages , but i submit that obama may be an istp . as most everyone has said , he exhibits some fe . he comes across as less ... no way in hell that mitt romney is an extraverted feeler . he does kinda give out an estj vibe at the debates . but i still think he seems too soft and nice to be an estj . that could just be because he is old , i guess . a couple of her songs ( and videos ) are a little bit catchy , but in general i think her stage personality and her music are annoying . when she does interviews and acts a little more like a normal ... fucking calm down . they can look similar because neither one has strong ne , and they are both judgers , and their feeling functions are near the middle . ni and si resemble each other in appearance . ... maureen maher i don't know well , but from looking at that video i would guess either istj or esfp . taylor swift is either isfj , esfj , or entp . i'm kinda leaning toward isfj but it is ... i think he just seems a bit feely because he is a very liberal istj , which relates to the fact that he is a professor . i already said he is an estp . he is not a judger . i don't know where you're getting the te from . he's not very into the rules at all . what about putting the beeper on gus's car ... i'm not a huge fan of this show , but i nonetheless got sucked in and watched all the episodes . captain weaver - - estj professor mason - - istj hal ( oldest ) - - enfj ben ( middle ) - - istp ? matt ... actually , i did not watch those videos above prior to posting . i had watched another video a while back ( which i cannot find now ) that seemed infj . she does seem like an isfp in the interviews posted ... watson does have fe , but he is not particularly feely at all . sherlock most likely does have thinking as his dominant function and feeling as his inferior . but he does not at all seem ... most of the people in this thread apparently have zero ability to recognize fe . walter is not an intj . give me a break . intp , like the first guy said , was at least a better guess . and hank is not an ... i verify walter - - isfj jesse - - istp , maybe estp badger - - esfp skylar - - hard to classify , maybe enfp , or possibly something like infj junior - - entp hank - - estp marie - - infp gomez - - isfj crazy ... watson comes across as an estp , maybe istp . in the books i would definitely say isfj . holmes i was thinking entj , possibly intj . like others have said , istp is not that bad a guess , either . but ... zero 11 i think it's easy to look like an extravert if all you do is perform on video . in my mind she seems to exhibit too much feeling to be an enfp . agent doggett estj i could maybe see esfj for the cancer man , but it's been several years since i finished the show so i'm not sure . i was having trouble deciding between entj and istj . leaning toward the latter . for one thing , intps don't primarily trust their guts . they trust logic . the show doesn't provide many examples of investigation by batista . but when he does investigate , he usually comes ... quinn is the one who is a classic esfp . batista definitely seems to express his emotions outwardly . i think dexter is an istp . he always pretends to be a geek , but really he is basically a jock . and all the obsession with physical action and killing people suggests se . he tries to be very ... i don't know about healthy , but esfp seems pretty obvious '
