' i got a new puppy ( 10 weeks old ) a week ago . why on earth did i pay $ 2000 for a puppy ? what the hell was i thinking ? why did i do this to myself ? somebody please tell me that this will get better . i ... i don't even understand what just happened . dude . are you sure we aren't the same person ? i just haven't gotten the dyeing or spinning down , but i did get an angora rabbit . i love making my own things . and i would totally make my own soap ... i think i could definitely significantly hinder a murder investigation if i put my mind to it . even a little bit of forethought can seriously complicate the investigation . of course , i'm not ... nooo ... ooo ... ooo ... to be fair , most of my yes's were from times when i was on the insane emotional roller coaster that is love . and it did ask have you ever not do you routinely . i sing ... along to songs ... in the car ... which is like singing in the shower i guess ? however , that doesn't mean that i'm actually any good at it so i refrain from subjecting people to it . though i ... i work with fabric patterns quite a bit with my hobby ( quilting ) and i don't think i'm particularly obsessed with them . but ... one of the quirks i have with patterns is if they are misprinted and ... so . i actually passed by the skin of my teeth ( 10 ys ) and appear to be human . so , that's awkward . 1 . yes . there are a select few people that i find intimidating . i usually also end up admiring them . in school they almost always ended up being my favorite teachers . i can think of 3 people off ... i think i have many inner circles ... like ... like an onion ? lol i really haven't explored that thought enough to elaborate on it . but i guess basically i am willing to hang out with you on a ... i like to classify myself as creative - in that i like to physically create things . not necessarily that i'm doing to express emotion or whatever . i can appreciate fine art on a technical level , ... when you put it that way then yes i do the same . however so far this has largely resulted in me having no relationships at all which makes me wonder if its a bad idea . what i was thinking of up there ... on the subject of different sherlock portrayals , i'm almost certain shawn spencer from psych is one but i'm not experienced enough in typing to know what he is . house is also a sherlock ... ick . i definitely don't have a lifetime plan because many of the things i want to do may never well happen and i can't make them happen ( like getting married and having a family chiefly - that's the ... oh and i would also like to put out there that i think i would do quite well in law , but like , i would want to be a judge . that just wasn't in the cards for me though . no , i just lead with that to head off the dumbshits who says well technically everything we do is driven by survival first herp de derp ! i mean , duh , everybody does shit just to survive . that's ... my eyes just completely glazed over . that may very well have been where i read that . if true it makes me wonder if i'm not seriously attracted to my own type in literature . i read an argument somewhere that snape is not an intj because ( as it was put ) everything he does is motivated by emotion ( chiefly his love for lily ) . i forgot what that made him , though . sherlock ... riversong - you are just about the coolest shit ever . i wish i did your shit but if i were doing it i would breed angora goats for fiber , crochet shawls and afghans ( which i admittedly already do ) , ... having annoying people leave me alone all day every day . world domination is so much hassle . ain't nobody got time for that ! i love living alone . when i bought my ( 3 bedroom ) house i was asked if i was going to get roommates . hell no i'm not getting roommates ! i made sure i could afford this bitch on my own ! unless it's an ... i just got back from a 6 hour flight ( my longest ever ) a couple days ago . on they way there i mostly dozed because it was so early in the morning and i had to catch some sleep if i was going to stay ... my mother started going grey at 19 . i made it to 20 before i found my first one . one of the perks of dying my hair blonde is that the grey hairs are far less noticeable . my dad , however , is 56 and ... i do superstitious when i'm having trouble doing something and it's frustrating me . but i will do super intellectual in relationships . i have a tie between word of affirmation ( because i'm horribly horribly insecure , i guess ) and quality time ( clingy ? great ) , with physical touch coming in just shy at third ( i'm a secret cuddlebug ) ... i'll answer this generally i guess . the smallest apartment i've lived in was just shy of 500 square feet . i do find existing in small spaces to be sort of thrilling . but it's more the thrill of ... well i'd be interested but it's much too short notice at this point . and also i'm not sure i have a working mic . last time i tried i think i managed to make my computer stop recognizing it was even ... i chose once a week but that is really the max for me . i based this on when i had a best friend ( that wasn't a coworker ) in the same area as me and we would hang out about once a week . any more than ... back story : my name means honeybee and i'm starting to be attracted to bees and hexagons / honeycomb things family inside joke : aunt : did you bring your lunch or ride the bus today at school ? ... stability / survival ( or rather , keeping myself in the manner to which i have become accustomed ) and after that is satisfied , knowledge . i've had people remark to me that i am always learning something ... hmm , i grew up basically not realizing that my family was actually christian . we were just totally secular and it surprised me when i figured out in like my late teens that my family actually was ... https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/555766_10151417215863425_928795763_n.jpg it's me ! i'm hamming it up , lol . btw , where is our death glare thread ? i thought we had one but i can't find ... ok here's why i would say i'm not motivated by money . i make enough money to live in the manner to which i've become accustomed ( which is middle class ) . if i didn't make enough to do this , then yes i ... well my sister typed as istj , but i haven't typed my parents yet . we definitely had our difficulties when we were younger . mostly i see her as kind of anal , lol . caregiver makes me think of someone taking care of old people with alzheimer's . personally i'm put off by being called the mastermind , because as cool as that sounds i keep imagining i'm the ... i've always been a very light sleeper even as a baby . i have trouble falling asleep and even small noises can wake me up ( like the cat using the scratching post ) and so i tend to never want to wake ... uh hmm ... i think most of my zoning out happens because i get bored . like whatever is going on isn't interesting enough to capture all my attention . so a lot of times what i do is deliberately split ... here's my caveat : i am by no means an expert . i've never typed anybody ever . so if someone more qualified wants to come along and weigh in , please do so . i can only say that you do remind me of ... i crochet mostly shawls - one day i will finally make one that i like enough to take to work . also afghans , though i've never finished one ( severe project add ) , and a bit of amigurumi . i can ... number one thing i hate so much it is absolutely political : animal rights . not to be confused with animal welfare . just don't even get me started on the hsus . i also hate the moral justification ... dogs . seriously , dogs are one of my specialties . i am a straight up dog snob . it's political for me , baby . also i may have spent several years of my life pretending to be a dog . and only ... yeah , only the coffee robot says hi and that makes me sad ( ok not really , i actually looked at other intro threads to see the response so i would know if i should be upset about being snubbed or not , ... maybe i've just always understood it better . i heavily identify with the descriptions i've read explaining the introvert energy thing - more specifically the i need to be alone to recharge my ... i failed my driving test twice before i passed . the first time because the lady proctoring it was so frigid she gave me massive test anxiety ( the only time i've ever experienced that ) and i ... hi . so i'm an intj female . my areas of expertise include several fiber arts ( quilting , crochet , cross stitch , though i want to expand to spinning and weaving ) , and dogs . and before you go pegging me ... i don't strongly identify with science . science was spoiled early on for me because i felt all the things i could possibly do with my resources had already been answered , therefore there was no ...
