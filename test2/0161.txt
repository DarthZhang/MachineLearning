' dear self , seems like you are going to keep being a level 1 mage for a while . truth is you still don't know what the hell you are doing . it's okay i guess . you got a lot to deal with as is . deep ... dear self , not sure how you managed to attract the attention of two guys at the exact same time , but you'll probably have to chose soon . they'll both be at the same party , so good luck figuring ... you know you're a ixfj when having a lot of social plans up in the air simultaneously makes you anxious . i need to be able to plan for how long i need to be in a social mood lol . dear everyone , why is it always when i'm super busy that you all want to hang out with me ? not that i'm complaining . i actually like it , but wow i am doing a lot of logistical gymnastics to make ... i think this can be the case in one-one-one dynamics though it can be trickier in groups with weak se . sometimes i am pretty off and socially awkward if i have been left to my own devices too long ... good points ! does this come in english ? ... nevermind ! just had to change the language settings ! at least you said please . : laughing : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v71c6NDs5VI basically , this means it's not going to work out in the longterm until you want it to work out longterm , which is fine as long as you are honest about it . most people just don't like being strung ... sounds like a pain in the ass ! honestly , as fun as it can be , not sure if i can keep up . you guys get bored really quickly lol . even us ni-doms that are more of a puzzle to figure out than average , you still can get bored with , ... does the untethered ne-dom have patience for us ? edit : oh you asked how ! not sure honestly . i think we are just fascinated with it ! dear self , how did your schedule fill up with so many activities so quickly ? looks like you are on another rollercoaster for the next few months . not sure how you're going to handle it , but i ... https://media.tenor.com/images/84c14882ede96590b4495cae771fdc76/tenor.gif when i'm in a social mood , i think i generally can make a charming first impression , but i am probably an acquired taste in consistent interactions as my eccentric and somewhat opinionated nature ... you care about humanity as a whole , but generally don't like ( not necessarily dislike , but not particularly fond of either ) , or are not interested in , most people individually . you make an effort to ... and usually your opinion is different from both of theirs or you're somewhere in between as you can see some merit on both sides . nice ! i actually have a considerable collection of infj and intj friends and family members . i met at least 2 intj girls ( one i was fairly good friends with ) , one of my best friends is an intj trans ... i thought this was just pretty common in general lol . it's either because i don't want to make small talk with a random acquaintance or person i barely know or it's because i do not have the ... checked out the voting simulators they have , too , and that is also really neat ! this is very fascinating ! i was able to calculate the correct answer for the first scenario , but i got too lazy and just guessed for the later two . for my own playing strategy , i chose cooperate 3 ... i guess i am somewhere in the middle . i enjoy interacting with people on here and exploring ideas , but i also feel like i have a decent ( albeit also spread out ) community in real life as well . home ... sounds a bit like imposter's syndrome to me or just a general lack of faith in your own abilities . maybe you are just highly self-critical and don't give yourself enough credit , and maybe a bit ... outside of this forum , i think the only type i got to know fairly well in person is an estp , and honestly i admired and fell for him even though he also frustrated me at times . he just had so much ... okay , understood . you were explaining your istp functions . i just misread where in some places you said ( like ntps ) . blaming my weak se lol . my apologies oh great lord of tinkering ! : wink : actually , ntps use ne / si , not se / ne , but i guess technically everyone uses alls the functions lol . ha ! i can relate to this description , too , lol . the istp function stack is ti-se-ni-fe in case you were wondering , so they actually have the same four functions in their functional stack as us infjs , just scrambled up differently lol . i was complete and utter shit at this as i didn't even notice one change because i was trying too hard to focus on a few things i expected to change that didn't lol . i think to describe sensing as basic is rather discrediting to sensors . advanced sensory functioning can be just as impressive as advanced intuition . as an intuitive , while the abstract comes ... the only advice i'd really give is just be honest . otherwise , just make sure you pick an opportune time where they are not too distracted and are ready to listen , not that i would expect that to be ... like said , i actually sometimes just self-sooth , too , when i'm sad though sometimes i appreciate a listening ear just so i can verbalize my thoughts and sort things out . i think she ... no problem ! glad to help ! :p roud : i think it depends on the individual and the situation , so i'll just state how it is for me . if i am severely upset to the point of crying , i probably would just want emotional validation . if i'm ... dear self , you need to start getting yourself back in order . that means normal sleep cycle , spending less time distracting yourself online , getting work done more efficiently , and making more of ... this description is so fitting ! it reminds me of this song . https://youtu.be/uxOz7EYzVAQ a lot of people in general can frustrate me regardless of personality type . it's less frustrating when communication is clearer and more reciprocal . for me , it's actually ( at least in part ) about finding a happy medium between those people that hardcore already want to get married and settle down and people that are only really interested in ... yeah , i get that , too . in my case , i think it's also because i am a bit socially awkward , too , lol . though compared to how socially awkward some people i meet are , i look like a socially adept genius ... these are good points . i do have a tendency to see potential in people though this sometimes gets me in trouble because having potential does not equate to using potential . i've had to learn that not ... good point . people of different backgrounds and identities doesn't inherently make them odd , just different from me . maybe i just mean that the group of people i know does not appear very ... yeah , it probably isn't . i just thought the high frequency of occurrence for me was above average is all . maybe it isn't though . i just found it strange when both my k - 12 and undergrad institutions ... hi fellow infjs , i was wondering if you also experience this phenomenon . i've noticed that basically my entire life , that i have a tendency to attract an odd assortment of people without doing so ... sounds exactly like one of my guy friends . he's clinically depressed , so i don't want to make him feel worse . i know some of his unattractiveness is just because he's so poor like he has really bad ... i think some of the trouble is that a lot of movies have lost their rewatchability . sure , some films i enjoy and am awed by initially , but after i get the gist there's no reason for me to go back ... for me , it usually depends on my workload and stress levels on how organized i am . moderate workload and stress levels are ideal for me organization-wise because my mind is engaged and motivated , but ... wow ! how did she react ? i have a hard time telling people that they are ugly , especially in circumstances where i know there's no easy fix for them . many people can improve their looks just with ... yeah , i can relate here . i am more likely to omit parts of the truth than to flat out lie . i have this one guy friend that is a total emotional wreck that i am pretty sure he couldn't handle the ... dear infx friend ( probably infp ? ) , it's not that i dislike you , but i must maintain strong boundaries because you are immature , undisciplined , and rather emotionally toxic . i know you are dealing ... i don't have a job . https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/57/db/36/57db36029f1c97967545a949f2ccddd.jpg '
