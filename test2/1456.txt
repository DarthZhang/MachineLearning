i'm lost . i like to just live in the forest where no one bothers me or live in alaska or ... i remember the first time i learned what death is ... and i cried a lot . i hate driving . i feel handicapped . all i do is move my arms and barely move my head . i like an open road so i can drive really fast because it's fun . driving with other bad drivers gets me nervous ... i rage like crazy internally and when it comes out , you're in for a world of my hell . i start thinking crazy thoughts . imagining many ways to kill that person ( which i really don't want to kill at ... yes . a simple question i asked , just one simple , easy question i asked , and they don't answer back just 30 seconds after the person texted back and i asked a question and don't get any answer back ... seriously . i get lost in buildings very easily . lol . endless internal voice awesome ! i really like these living quarters / ideal houses . it makes me really happy . wtf ?

i'll research more on that . i have trouble typing tails . i know sonic is an estp . the types i come up with is infp , and infj . fi is there , ti is there , ne is there or ne , these are my thoughts and i'm unsure . anyways , let me ... you know you're an infp after you read this . go to google and type in personality type project handbook . click on the very first link and read the pdf . it is the best , easiest , most simple test ... lol . i hate , i really hate to be taken for granted . it's something i want to change . i wish it never happens to me . then i'd be more happy . but some are just too damn lazy . ask when you actually need help ... ... damn . i'd go insane ! sent from my lgl 86c using tapatalk * hugs back * ty . i feel better now . sure . why not ?
