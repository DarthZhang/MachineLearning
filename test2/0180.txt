if you do the chasing , how do you go about it ? what has worked for you in the past ? what have you tried that failed ? ... i think the question should be , where do accountants or engineers hang out ? have you ever been surprised by someone showing interest in you , that you thought was being platonic / friendly ? * hides under table * : spacecraft - 1 : from https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/type3 you're not an asshole , you're looking out for yourself . so do that then just in case , fyi : codependency for dummies cheat sheet - dummies what qualifies as judgement to you ? can you give an example ? yeah , except nobody is the same , and the questions are tailored to the person . it's still going to be a lot . ok , i appreciate the response . i also get where you are coming at , for instance , if the person was to tell about what they want and then the other person adjusts accordingly . yeah that could be a red ... i think the way you respond to me already speaks volumes and answers most of my questions about your type , so i'll continue to wait for the rest to respond and see what they make of it . hopefully it ... thanks , so the what do you want is a question that is big , overall , what do you want , when out on a coffee date context . i'm there sitting in front of you , do you know what you want ?

how does the enfp feel when asked a lot of questions by someone she barely knows ? yeah exactly , you could see him mature , or is it relax and open up on tv . i think he probably did grow up with some form of codependency ( based on his childhood description ) , but it seems like he ... i think eric handled himself well , and peter put his foot in his mouth when he said rachel would have a mediocre life , he apologised for it , but rachel then said : i don't think this show works for ... i really hope the next bachelor is going to be eric . my attempt to flirt with enfp does not work office romance is difficult . i don't think i could , do long distance for 15 years . do you know anything about personality theory ? i think you should confront him and ask if he is in to you . wouldn't that be a site to see . well the intj will just motivate and keep you focussed , that's all . if you want to jump off the bridge , we will make damn sure you will be the best jumper off that bridge . even if it leads to your ... i find the responses funny though . you know , if it was as easy as that . but i will quote from the book how everyday stress brings out our hidden personality by noami l . quenk , page 76 dominant te-types different planets , i ... so i couldn't find a thread , figured , lets create one . so intjs , what do you wish for in your life ?

that's social construct concepts don't fit in the intj's ...
