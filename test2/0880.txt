' seems like a good discussion . hope i won't derail it completely . here goes my 2 cents : well , i'd take knowledge to mean an apprehended truth . truth being a concept which corresponds to ... entps are great at making me put aside my needless musings and act . as for vocalizing , it's not so much talking about myself or stuff i like , but , well , just talking , in general . my team leader is an ... as an extroverted judging type , i would suppose enfjs use their auxiliary ni for perceiving patterns emerging from their social interactions , acting as a conductor for analyzing the relationships ... basically , you'd see a lot of fe ( intp fe , that is ) , an overly concern of looking uncool , a quiet attitude and perhaps some evasion . the intp is rather oblivious to how their actions might be ... although i agree with the beside the point bit , in that , say , an entj isn't as willing to entertain an idea merely for its conceptual value , or as amused by a joke dealing with logical ... it seems we have very different standards of evidence then . again , i don't see where it is implied that the intp must be the sole reciever of intellectual openness . it is stated , towards the end of ... i'm not sure why anyone would put on an article about how to get better acquainted with an intp that they should be bent , nor do i think it is implied anywhere that the intp does or should only ... you might want to try te instead . no offense intended , but infps don't mesh well with ti . developing ti is not the same as becoming well versed in philosophy or anything of the sort , it really is ... out of every point made , i think #11 is the most important . any person incapable of self-analysis and self-correcting ( i . e . thinking for themselves ) is absolutely not a candidate to be in my most ... is he entj or estp ? indeed . i try to loosely apply moore's law to human development as much as possible . within a years time , i expect of myself to have doubled my skills at whatever i consider important during that ... it's not entj , it's just nt with dominant thinking . although we live in opposite worlds ( ej vs ip ) the thought process is very much the same ; such is the contrast relationship of functions . i too can ... you might want to read up on cognitive functions ; te & fi for entj and fe & ti for enfj . your mannerisms seem enfj to me so far , but your modus operandi should be examined by yourself ultimately ... yes , your posts do contain an enfj flavor and a tendency towards introverted thinking ( ti ) . the fact that you're doubting your decision not based ( at least as far as described ) on experience and ... yeah , enfjs generally know what they want . they're ejs after all . one entj and one intj , it seems . failed troll is fail . actually , that was a yes . to end my digression , long term or serious is a superset of marriage . thanks for the clarification . given the options , 2 , entj . isfjs are usually very easy to get along , but hardly anything beyond that ( well , at least at this point in life ) . intuitors would probably be a better choice . i'm not sure ... dude , in this world where nobody gives a shit , having an estj around who can and does verbalizes his / her concerns and brings a critical eye to the table is quite soothing , actually . i wouldn't go ... accomplishment is really a volatile thing in my life , no long lasting effects , though my mood might improve without me realizing it . as per your definition of accomplishment , i think it won't appeal ... street smart is more relevant to social applications than academic , imo . either way , to say that street smart means talented or predisposed isn't a satisfying definition . i would rather say ... and here i thought i was weird ... : mellow : hmm , according to the test , it looks like i'm an infj after all , lol . though i do find that some physical characteristics are related to type , but mostly as a consequence of a tendency of behavior ... my working definition is : someone with which you can freely engage intellectually without getting your egos involved . the result is incredible stimulation for both parties with little to no concern ... the intjs who act condescendingly towards me usually get blown out of the water when things get serious , so i don't really bother about them . the ones who are open-minded and approachable , even if ... wait guys , i think he's posting from soviet russia ... it is inevitable . i would add that the acquisition of knowledge itself is often made the same way . i think the op's characterization is quite correct . however i don't think it is accurate to pit these differences between ti and te , as some have ; given that those functions are not equally expressed ... people seem to be confusing achievement with personality traits ... it might even have an impact on your productivity ( or your perception of it anyways ) , but don't be so quick to dismiss your ... it's just a matter of how much stupidity you can take . triumph , perhaps ? i have one , thank you very much ... : frustrating : wouldn't have it any other way though . :p roud : probably because you were proud of your achievement but got unjustly ( i think ... ) accused instead of recognized . is your teacher an nt by any chance ? the only guarantee you have in life is that it ends . too bad atheism and agnosticism were mumbled up together . agnosticism is also an orthogonal concern , not dealing with belief , but with knowledge . of course neither is the case that atheism and ... as pointed out , speech-isms are a powerful tool to smooth-out a conversation . being creative in our wording is also very useful to add a refreshing or spicy tone to our conversations , especially ... pretty sure all nts are like that ... i have to say , i see no further than a shallow stereotypical analysis in the excerpts . extroverts definitely have a different style of communication from introverts , often more energetic , personal ... because we rather rule minds . * raises hand * why the hell am i on this thread anyway ? : mellow : i don't . hence the is it just me part . : cool : the ability to troll them , though , pure intp awesomeness . is it just me or this thread became just a playground for entj wanna-bes ? well , when you refer to something as abstractly as the paranormal you should be aware of the broadness of the term - though i'm sure the hobbit and robots thing was just a reduction to the absurd ... oh really ? xd wait , what ? : mellow : i suppose the scenario you're trying to convey goes somewhat like this : your significant other is in distress and needs your help , although he / she is the one to blame . our fellow intjs , however , ... talk about going off on tangents ... i wonder what a similar thread aimed at nts would be called if it were created on the nf forum .
