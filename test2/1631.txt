' someone called me a sociopath . i immediately went to wikipedia to look up exactly what it is . then proceeded to give them a lecture on how i am not a sociopath , but could be considered as such . ... a blank stare with a lightly raised eyebrow this was a great response ! your bit about the nt's desire to ... figure out the puzzle was perhaps very accurate , and makes much sense to me as how that could be . of couse , i desire to help ... imma t btws :p we ask strange questions like that to get insight into people so as better to understand them and interact better with them , should we so desire ... for what purpose does the infj seek to understand someone's thoughts ? ... damn ... mmmk ... well thank you for your input all . i appreciate it sexy logic is the kind used to deduce the most sensitive parts of a woman's body . scientific method in bed ? ! * gasp * intj's have feelings too . _ . the last line makes sense , but just barely :p i often feel the need to send people hugs and other such feeling things ... hrm . the light at the end of the tunnel ... is this in reference to ... indeed ! but the music always stops ... sure i've been damaged ... but that didn't change who i am . i've had people assure me of things i like about myself . i am only in a position to be pushed to the side when no one has the desire to ... personally find infj's quite easy to understand . intj's and infj's think along the same lines . in fact , i'm beginning to wonder if intj's and infj's are the same , just intj's have their emotion ... so what i'm basically reading here is that ... the ... love , if you will , does not fade for quite some time ? on your first love , how was it that you ceased believing he was the one ? how long did it ... infj , has problems with getting over first love , for it was percieved as perfect despite obvious flaws , and feels deep emotions still which are holding back her life . i suppose my question ... this is a good representatino of intj emotions . ahh the fantasies of being in a position where massive amount of people will listen to you . i've been there many times . also you know you are an intj when your dad walks into your room , and ... yeah i had . that's when she felt ... like she wanted to be in a relationship with me , that a part of me does love you , but i'm being cautious i find it difficult to believe she just altogether ... well , she decided that instead of having her love depend on someone else ... she was going to find a way to be happy without anyone else ... essentially , trying to be happy and alone . sort of ... it would explain why a particular infj was falling for me ... and for awhile comfortable with that idea . then the very idea of being in a relationship seemed like a bad idea to her > < * whines ... unfortunately in my experience it isn't too far from the truth . but we'll see . limerence is an involuntary cognitive and emotional state of intense romantic desire for another person . the term was coined by psychologist dorothy tennov to describe the ultimate , near-obsessive ... indeed it is weak , however sometimes it is good to let it out . i hid things i disliked about my ex , afraid to upset her , but in the end it fell apart anyways . course , letting that out may have ... i suppose what i'm getting at is that you cannot drastically change who you are . ahhh fantastic , im not alone ! for the good of everyone else amirite ? ahhh the best part is when they do , and you know they are listening xd get a lot of o . o thefux ? extremist ? maybe . and no , the things i do / say are not relevant , whilst such things can be inherited , it is stil me and me is all i have , all i have to work for , and it is for me that i do ... indeed . we have a softer side than most know about ... just hard to get to ;) lmao . i actually have the ( almost ) exact same deal going on with an infj right now . and she lives 2 states away > < ! when your esfj ex tells you she thinks you are a sociopath when you stare girls in the eyes without smiling , and their smile dies and they look away . ( i'm just waiting for one to do the same thing ... first time i saw it . but i knew what it meant ( third comment in original post clarifies that ) oh lookitthat . my ex actually accused me of being a sociopath after we broke up , saying that i see her as a fake person . that's an sf for you ... what i would do for a woman who didn't foolishly get in a bunch because i've never brought her flowers ... - sigh - no . they serve no purpose . holy crap a female intj . and as for boring nature , nay . we the e / i nt j / p's are not boring in fact we are the most interesting of them all , however the layman would consider us to be a bore , ... welcome to ... the forum ... prepare to discover you are nothing special :) this is a really good list and i agree 100 % on it . and yes , i'm entj when i am not desiring solitude . like when i'm not single . when you said darker side , i thought yo uwere referring to the part where i often want to purge millions of people from the face of the earth . this is the kind of thing that led me to believe that what we think is just me is actually multiple beings and the survival of the human body is dependent upon cooperation between all of them . ... that sounds significantly similiar to a recent email from an infj in which i was being turned down o . o every person is unique huh ? nah . just brain cells exciting neurons in a system inherited ... because it's what floats their boat . if life feels more meaningful for doing such a thing , let them have that . i fear ... no internet no internet no inernet aaahhh losing the internets is the worst thing evar , its ' like when you break up with a girl , and it's unexpected as hell and you try using the ... this rings quite true . perhaps intj's just need periods of being single , and periods of being partnered ? just broke up with girlfriend of 3 years , yesterday . wasn't working out . pertaining to what happened today ... you know you're an intj when an officer pulls you over for going 87 in a 55 zone , and the first thing you say after he asks you sir , why were you going so ... i'm just waiting for the day when we have a king and a queen and both are competent . you know you're an intj when someone tells you about a situation in their life , complaining how they are so confused by it and then they ask you if you are confused by their situation as well . and ... hahahahah it's so true . i'll have to add that to my intj list ... hahah that gave me quite a laugh . though i doubt that was their plan update on this story she did come back to me and she was very apologetic , told her i understood completely . she gave me her email such that i could contact her again . as suggested earlier , i ... intimidating ? i find intimidating in a woman to be extremely attractive . course i'm an intj just like you . we'd end up killing eachother . he is definitely an intj , and he definitely has not figured himself out completely . myself an intj , i get pissed at my girlfriend for tripping over things ... or dropping things ... because it seems ...
