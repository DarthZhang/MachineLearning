' all in twilight have you read the power of now by eckhart tolle or any of his other teachings ? i ask because a lot of what you are saying it very similar to it . also , i really understood what ... wow . i really appreciate that you are willing to help me . this is something that i have been searching an answer for for quite some time . without further ado here are my responses to your questions : ... here is my response to another thread about the greatest insults . some other enfps gave some really good insights already , but for me personally i have a few things . 1 ) to be called unworthy or ... at the risk of beanie not seeing the above post i'll actually put my stuff down here : 1 . my drive in life comes from the desire to be the best i can be . i want to keep improving daily . my goals ... haha glad i could help . i have to say , as far as the 4 progression i can definitely relate to the 1-4 part . i'm not sure about the 2 yet though . also , for some reason as soon as you said , it's ... rawr it makes me so mad just thinking about it . one of my other friends is like , that's just who he is .. * * * that ! no excuse to act that way . but , i can't get too upset about this , i'm trying to ... oh my god ! this , this , and this ! i remember one time i was telling my friends about how i was talking to new people and how cool they thought i was . some thinker , judger type said , yeah . keep ... i just posted here recently , but after some research i am fairly certain that i am an image type . for me , i have to admit i constantly find myself asking the question who am i ? . or maybe it isn't ... thanks a lot . i really appreciate insight from another enfp . on a side note , i've been looking into enneagram type to help me with this even more . jealousy . insecurity . any number of reasons really . well since a few people enjoyed my last post . i thought it was time to bring out the big guns . this is my new motivator . part ii let's go ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4Kft47kBM how do i stop thinking about that ? and what if someone tries to get in my way ? what if someone actually tries to sabotage my goals ? it'd be great if you could elaborate more . :) holy crap . if there is one post here that i wish all of the esfjs would read , it's this one . that 1st part is so perfect and describes exactly what happened . just one thing though , it's been like ... such a great post . i have to say that , personally , when i do commit to something and am motivated about something is it powerful . i don't know how it is for others , but when i truly want to do ... haha . well ... yolo i guess . worse case scenario we just don't end up talking , and that isn't too different from right now anyway . r u sure ? i mean , i admit i have a tendency to do that , but still . i mean did you notice all the stuff in my above post . did you see and understand all those concerns ? can you really tell me to just ... wait . this is exactly what i did last time , well almost . i walked away and literally did not talk to her for a long time . was that the right response ? i didn't know how to act in social scenarios ... damn , figures that i get here when you guys have already covered just about everything . :p well , i'm not sure how true this is for other enfps , but i remember constantly talking with my enfj ... and if she does say no and i respond with the whole thank you thing , should i then suggest being friends ? would that be the best way to handle it ? seriously ? it's just ... i don't know . i figured it wouldn't work like that . i figured that she wouldn't want me to do something out of the blue . i figured that i should know whether or not she likes ... oh my god ! i have been waiting for a topic like this for so long ! i listen to this every day . it is the most motivational thing i have ever seen . here it is : ... to be fair , i only had to wait a day . but , i'm losing it waiting to hear your responses and your point of view b / c i have no idea what she is thinking and other esfjs are my only hope at having a ... seriously ? that's it ? haha . i mean i was hoping you could at least tell me whether she was actually interested again or if she was doing this b / c it was some esfj thing . plus , we literally haven't ... btw , in case any other esfjs see this , here is the link to my thread : http://personalitycafe.com/esfj-forum-caregivers/148066-need-help-esfj-girl.html as i'm finding out the hard way . awesome ! could you go to the esfj forum and respond to my thread ? i am really confused about the way this esfj girl is acting . are you sure ? well alright then . i appreciate the input . :) we are a bit of a rarity (8 % of the population ) . tbh i haven't met another enfp in real life b4 . i come here when i need to converse with like minded fellows . :) seriously , i try posting on their main page , and maybe i'm being a little impatient , but don't you guys ever go on personality cafe at all ? alright b4 i begin i just want to say that i don't know 100 % that she is esfj . she is definitely extraverted , a feeler , and a judger though and that leaves enfj as the only other type . i've known a ... thanks i really appreciate you helping me out . :) however , i already predict that neither of those responses will work for one reason . he is doing this to make himself feel better . if i show him that ... omg more amazing advice . haha . also , i read something else about how the more we experience a situation , the less we care about it . i must admit it is not too often that i'm insulted . maybe this is a ... so many thanks for this , i just don't know . how do i steer clear ? i mean most of the time i can just not go and talk to him , but he'll say hi to me in the hall and i can't just ignore him . in fact , ... enfps are so cool and spontaneous and awesome ! ! ! i was having such a bad week , but after talking to a few like-minded people , oh my god what a difference . i think that's our greatest strength , ... damn we enfps are intuitive lol . yep , i'm really young ( let's just go with under 21 for now :p ) as far as the not giving a damn thing ... wow . i honestly didn't think it was possible for enfps to ... thanks man . it's ... comforting to know that i'm not the only one who feels that way . :) on a side note , how do you deal with cold rationals ? or people being insulting in that way in general ? being ... some other enfps gave some really good insights already , but for me personally i have a few things . 1 ) to be called unworthy or worthless . when someone tells me that i don't deserve something or ... one more thing , for all you emotionally-stable enfps how do you view other people ? to be specific , do you view certain people as bugs who don't matter ( i . e . people who put you down ) or do you view ... it's really strange . recently , i talked to my dad about a lot of my problems , every little thing that was causing me discomfort and that made me feel better . it's like a weight was lifted off me or ... thanks . i can't express how much i appreciate this . this one post really cheered me up a little . :) why must the insults of others ( even a single person whereas everyone else thinks otherwise ) affect enfps so much ? we care so much about other people , but that only causes us more pain . it sucks when ... i heard about ne on one of the tagged threads on either the enfp or functions main page . thanks a lot . i'll keep this in mind . :) thnx this is good advice . i actually have noticed the sensitive spells getting shorter , which is a plus . as far as overcomplicating function goes , could you explain how ne works then ? wow i know that i've heard some of this stuff before , but you just laid it out so well . that last part though . how do you know it's getting better ? hey guys . i just had an experience today where i was very happy and getting confident on a new clothing style , but one bad comment ( from a jealous person ) ruined my mood for the rest of the day . i ... lol alright i admit that's pretty funny , but now people have to go back a page to see what the topic was about . oh well . i guess the above answers this . :( oh boy , i've been figured out . :p but , in all seriousness it was one specific class . it doesn't happen often btw . ( or at least it is happening less and less . i have noticed that my confidence may ... '
