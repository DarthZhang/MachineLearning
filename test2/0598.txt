( see my previous comment ) i think you're right on with your b . comment . so many people are looking for excitement rather than a relationship . that ... that's really fascinating ... intellectual ... so , do you want to marry me ? jk . you brought up some really good points . i guess i'm into fitness because i'm into health . so for me it is not about ... no need to apologize ... i just get so ... what's the word .. mad lol ... when i learn about people ( and more specifically , fellow infps ) going through things like this with religion . it makes me realize ... so you mention the phrase several times my dreams ... what are your dreams ? good thoughts ! i didn't have anything in particular in mind ... and i wouldn't ever complain like that face-to-face with someone i was interested in . i guess i was just expressing my confusion ... i think all religion is just plain illogical and bad ... and for the weak who can't think for themselves and develop their own spiritual insights ( outside of religion ) . imagine a world without ... thanks ... that's a really good point ... people are intimidated with deep thinkers and seem totally confused when they encounter someone who genuinely is a caring person . i think society has wrecked ... okay , so ... i'm financially secure , great job ( as in i make > $ 120k a year ) , down to earth , non-dramatic , confident , healthy , pretty decently attractive physically , in shape ... educated ... could ... yes ! ! ! shame on those people . their definition of a man is only what they know . there are many , many ways to be a man ... and some are better than others . i think they lack balls because they have not ... best post ever ! ya ... extroverts can be really obnoxious in that way . i guess just choose who you allow into your life more carefully . if you want only introverts and more quiet types ... then make friends with those ... no ! and neither should you ! : angry : yeah ... i definitely do . part of me can be really , really emotional and warm with people . but , sometimes and in certain situations , i become very non-emotional and almost cold to people . in the ... amen ! infps ( especially males ) need to validate and encourage one another ... whether it is a friend or a stranger or someone you recognize as an infp and defend one another . this all makes great ... my sign is leo ... :) only you have the answer to your riddle . i think everyone is an individual . i think it is important though to talk about these things and to be honest when people ask . people think in definite labels , straight , bi , gay . if you say i'm ... i think about that a lot . how i wish i was born in another era , as so many other infps have said throughout this forum . we would have been appreciated so much more , and definitely more happy ... i hate talking on the phone too . it annoys me . i hate small talk . i think a lot of infps are either you're on my side or not when it comes to relationships / friendships and doors are closed when the person proves unable to stay on the infps side . i do this a ... infps can't be figured out ! ! ! haha when ever someone suggests a book and then ends up passing along their copy to you so you don't have to go out searching for it : laughing : lmao ! ! ! ... how simple for the author of that article to think there is one way to define a type . alas , another thinker fails . yes . it's just plain tacky . i think infp males just need different things . most other male types could boil their needs down to sex . or , i should say , if they are satisfied sexually , then they aren't complaining . but , for ... my favorite ... very right brained here . good at left brained things , too ... but , left brained activities are learned as opposed to natural . i replied to your initial thread titled need help . did you see my response . hope you are doing better today . it's all very unfortunate . so much greatness has been lost in society , and especially more and more every day ... but , not just because of media . i think through so many corrupt institutions , ... huh ? you quoted me but i dont follow your response in reply to what i said ? ? : unsure : everything you just described , i went through . i think so many infps go through this . so , first , don't feel alone and stuck . just realize you are in a phase and that phase will change whether you ... this is overly simplified and cliche ... but because it is true . and , it is vital ( read absolute ! lol ) that infps do what they love and learn to make money doing what you love . if you love to ... let me just say ... the term moderate was a fantastic word choice ... it cracks me up . : laughing : summer reading is the best ... because the books can just be light and enjoyable ... pure entertainment . you mentioned a lot of deep and complex books , which i love too , but i wouldn't call them ... well , i think in general a lot of infp men get referred to as pansies because of the common characteristic personality of the infp male . however , on the flip side , and for myself ... i'm not a pansy ... i'd say ... probably to have sex with them ( infps ) . i know people always understand me a lot better in infpness after sex because they see / feel / hear / smell / taste how passionate infps are . i think ... aweee . beauty is what you find inside . one day , you will find your soulmate ... someone who feels so attracted to you . don't give up . when you start believing and recognizing all the ways to be ... you are more into metaphor than anything literal . yes , and content ! ;) hi , meta maker . i just typed a long personal message , only to find after i click sent that i can't send pms to people yet since i'm new on here . wow ! way to lose a message i put time into in ... hi there ! thanks everyone for your responses . so kind of you to read my thread . any way ... if there is still confusion , i think the confusion is , again , in the definition of myth . i think ... hi there ! no need to apologize ... it is a complex , deep subject . if you are interested in a very thorough explanation of the concept , check out those books i mentioned . in a literal sense , ...
