' i have a bit of a hippie side to me but then again i really am a little bit of everything all rolled into one . infj , prefer someone with a feeling preference . infjs would have to be one of the most attractive personality types out there . please don't change anything about yourselves . if the average person doesn't get you , perhaps it is because you are ... why wouldn't you see the inside ? i can read souls , lol . i would have thought easily . not by me you're not . i quite like the entps i've known and think they are one of the better types out there . i am a good liar as i am a good actress but because i have such a strong conscience i usually don't take this road . when i first joined facebook i made another account under a different name . i never used it but just the act of making it was very empowering . the reason was that i found myself censoring much of ... i am really borderline infp / enfp . i do need time to recharge definitely but i am not your stereotypical shy infp . i love going out and meeting new people , i am first on the dance floor and will stay ... it really depends on the individual . i do tend to like all the nfs and have an immediate rapport with most of them . i can't see myself ever being with an istj or a estp or an entj . i am infp , i love hippie looking clothes or jeans and a leather jacket for casual . red is my favourite colour . to go out to a restaurant i would dress up quite a lot , classy i would say with a touch ... someone i click with and who has similar values to me . someone trustworthy , who makes me feel like i am the only girl in the room , not just by their words but by their actions . someone authentic and ... beautiful . yes your friend definitely looks introverted , for some reason i thought number 2 was the entj . well it sounds as though you are definitely an introvert , i am too but sometimes test as enfp because it ... i'm crap at this , maybe in real life i might be better . well he doesn't look intj but it is an intj posting it in and seeings they are not supposed to have friends i'll go with intj . he does look ... wait you're no . 5 and no . 1 is your brother . well i picked the hot brothers anyway . you look more enfj , definitely charisma and spark shining through . i would never pick your brother as intp from the ... yes i think maybe intp , his eyes do definitely have depth though . no 4 i think is infj or intp . he looks less outgoing and thoughtful . 3 of my 5 children are intps . there is no way in the world my daughter would ever be labelled aspergers although she can probably be slightly insensitive once in a while . my oldest son scores quite ... i don't know but no . 1 and n0 5 are hot , lol . quite good actually , not as good as dating another nf though . no i don't think people who are well off financially are poor in spirit but there are a sector of males who seem to think if they are rich that guarantees them success in the dating world . i am happy ... i don't know which women you are talking about but money would not be a factor for me . in fact i hate males who seem to think they can buy me . my soul is not for sale . if i had to list one of the ... i am infp but sometimes test as enfp . i'd rather date the psychiatrist because psychiatry is more interesting . it is something i am interested in and even given that he has much the same personality , ... i am most definitely not gullible . i usually find my intuitions to be correct about people however i do get myself into situations that others steer clear of because i am kind and also like to ... sts and xntjs hi and thanks for the welcome ! love them :) agree almost completely , what's wrong with a bit of sensitivity though ? hehe .. actually sps seem to like me much more than i like them . my last boyfriend was esfp and i have had a really hard time getting rid of him and i thought they were supposed to move on easily . i would ... actually i am quite good with strangers , will talk to anyone and am usually the life of the party if i actually choose to go to the party . as i said i am not a strong introvert but i still find i ... understandable homicide . well i don't know enough entjs to pass judgement really , there are people from all personality types who can easily rub us up the wrong way , i think it is more a persons character sometimes then ... possibly infps , i have to admit i have only known a couple of entjs but i thought both of them were arseholes . enfj eyes , the mixture between teddy bear and pure sexiness , true of all the male enfjs i have known . i have found them to be more stubborn then arrogant and trying to persuade them of your rightness on pure emotional reasoning doesn't always cut it . i do love their honesty though :) i actually have two adult children who are intps and also had a really close friend who was an intp . there is something i think to the old adage that the eyes are the windows of the soul and yes i swear that sometimes i can pick an infj just by looking at their eyes . there is something almost ... i am an infp and scored a 7 on that test but my intj ex husband would be a a 30 or more and one of my intp sons actually scored a 30 . my enfp son on the other hand scored a 13 . i am an infp , enneagram type 2 and i tend to find most infjs interesting . in my opinion your only problem is that you are going for the wrong types of girls . why not go for an infp who shares your values , there must be plenty of attractive infp women out there . not every ... haha , too funny ! i am infp and have been known to fall into either category , mind you i occasionally test as enfp , i am not strongly introverted . i am the best little slave unless you mess with my ... i've learnt to set boundaries with toxic people as i have matured . generally i get a gut instinct very early with people who are of the toxic variety but in the past was too kind to be able to shut ... i especially love the song lithium . i have 5 absolutely gorgeous kids ! they are totally amazing . i have only ever known one unhealthy one who i didn't like . not me i find them interesting most of the time . wholesome , pear-shaped farm girls with big hips ?
