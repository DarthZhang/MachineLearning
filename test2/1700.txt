' i say this with ulterior motives . i started a meetup a while ago in my area , so i'm also curious if anyone else is around here : siouxland infj meetup ( sioux falls , sd ) - meetup i'm also ... i think i know what you mean , thatkid . it's not enough to be present with extraverts , they expect us to carry a certain kind of energy to the conversation . something like a late night talk show or ... yeah , i know . sometimes i slip and wonder if there's some skill i need to focus on . and we all know the answer : stay in the present moment and just have fun . if she doesn't like me , it wasn't ... what a dumb feeling . i'm just fine socializing with people at work and one-on-one . i can shoot the breeze with the esfj there and have a great time because she's providing a lot of energy . so why ... i agree , it's tough . every field is like this today , unfortunately . i remember seeing flyers boasting that social work is the fastest growing field ! as states continue to add professional ... as a social worker , sequenceofsound brought the goods in this thread . if you go into this field , all your experience will help you at another level . i'm currently working in mental health care but ... transform the outside world into your internal one . exercise outside regularly and feel your mind's reaction to your body . go to a park and use your surroundings to inform what you write down . ... i love this . i have the same weird pauses and mannerisms in conversation . lots of psych majors . why am i not surprised ... i'm a therapist . :D i'd be open to talking with people 1:1 . i'm in my 20s - - as long as any of you out there at least that age , i don't care about other traits . you sound like a classic infj . i'm in close to the same boat . i have a good grasp on my feelings ' uses and don't need to ascribe more meaning to them than necessary . however , i also value myself ... it's not that we're necessarily just introverted , we're extraverted in such a niche way that we turn off with most people . that's the problem , really . or rather , my problem . i look outside and , despite sioux falls being the epicenter of nowhere , i find there is plenty to do . i have a park system that has all sorts of ... children of men the fountain ( op beat me to it ! ) pan's labyrinth keep attending activities that attract more high-brow conversation . i'm starting to go to freethinker meetings in my city and i can see a lot of potential infjs in that group . or , you know , meet ... my voice is all over the place . part of it is my diaphragm - - it's a good way to tell if i'm tired . sometimes others will joke with me about how svelte it sounds over a loudspeaker , other times ... you know , i'm not sure . i definitely know i don't connect with others as well as i should , but then again , school and work have cut me off socially in many ways . if i had to give a general answer , ... pull back from her stuff and focus on developing healthy rapport with your co-workers . the only way to win her game is to not play it . the real problem isn't your choice , it's the fact that she's ... i hear you . when i put on a facial expression , it's obviously put on . probably best that way ; there are too many people out there who know how to put on faces . with that said , you might be more ... my supposed shyness really depends on the people . there's only so much i can do with fe in a highly-charged s setting but i can do just fine in a laid-back place . with es , the whole point is chaos ... i'd be happy to find any kind of two-sided friendship , which is why i'm so frustrated with myself socially . i've tried and tried to meet others halfway , only to be pushed away . at this point , i ... this is just speculation on my part , but i think our perception of problems tend to come from an inferior se . that is , whenever we look through se , we see it the way we think a poor se stereotype ... lenore thomson writes that infjs often use ti , our tertiary function , to tune out of the world when we feel stressed . not projecting for anyone else here . i work some hours in a liquor store and find most of the regulars to be fairly friendly . if they want to do that on their time , go ahead . there are other , ... making final judgments on someone based on first impressions . there really is no point to alcohol . yes , a chemical depressant is going to liven the party up . and then we'll get sick afterwards . that makes perfect sense . social interactions are too easy to view from a relativist perspective . i often have to ask myself what i want from an interaction and if it will necessarily infringe on my boundaries , and vice ... ni : that person said to throw a party for someone . hmm . but what does that mean , really ? is modern society truly so generous as to give a citizen a celebration for his or her own benefit , or ... yeah , i've been there . whenever i get into that state of mind , i'm reminded of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC0NuBaliLs i think it's fairly simple . the healthy extraverts are already out socializing with each other . we're often on the edge of the room and willing to listen to someone . usually that someone doesn't ... excellent post , jawz . good social health is definitely not determined by personality type . when i facilitate groups at the hospital , i often see introverted folks engage in just as anti-social ... being gay is not necessarily the big stigma , it's just being perceived as less masculine , e . g . less like a white male in power . oh , he's gay , but at least he acts like a man . this extends down ... i've felt better about my true self since finding out about the infjs forum and here . it's still not easy in rl but at least i have a half-formed compass now . even if you pull back your efforts , you will still get different responses from different people . you might be seen as too helpful or unhelpful despite what you're thinking . i just focus on what's ... it's a matter of perspective . we infjs often possess an inner mission that can seem other-worldly to those who don't share it . it's a great trait to have but it will look different to different ... many people still think borderline psychotic when they hear about bpd , which just isn't true . it refers to behavior that lies between totally passive and totally anti-social . unfortunately , it's ... i'd feel out the amount and intensity of negative emotions and take it from there . i would ask questions and advise but also do so at the same emotional level that person is experiencing . i'm this way too but i'm still very infj . the ni-fe loop can sometimes create energy if we translate more of the external world into abstract thoughts . no one in the external world . there seems to be a common trend ( here and on the infjs forum ) of constantly trying to understand oneself and finding true authenticity , which can feel like a battle . ... the jedi / the monk - hiding in plain sight , we look like we know more than we let on , even if we really don't . the astral warriors - we're often fighting emotional battles away from everyone else ... high school through college was the worst time i've been through . the crisis of deciding what to do next took about three months and then i was off to the races . not looking back . i'm finding ... i have no regrets about past actions . i only measure my current quality of life . that said , i've often tried too hard to be sj ... you can imagine the consequences . hey , so it is ! it likely does say something about us . maybe it means that it's less healthy for us to be around types that need to relieve stress externally without taking some steps first . the clients i've seen in therapy who have demonstrated infj traits were unhealthy enough to be anti-social and suffer emotional intensity disorder . the doorslam was being used for all sorts of ... if you think male brutality and chauvinism somehow empowers women , as the director described it , watch suckerpunch . i saw it in theaters , unfortunately . that article describes me pretty well . i get into an obsessive state when writing papers so that i can focus on the details better . i take too many notes so that i can pare it down into something ... funny you mention the apes . in another documentary that same group suffered an outbreak of disease when they found food in a trash site . because the aggressive apes got all the food , they died . ... i'm more in-between here . i'm very ethical in outlook and activity but my affect tends to show as intuitive , likely due to a need to turn off ni when surrounded by people . the idealist works in the background until the time is right with a slow , steady , secret strategy . if it's successful , it will already be in place and working before the public notices . ideally ... without the j , i would be stuck in another world . i'm glad to finish what i start .
