' note : i haven't read the whole thread , but i want to inject my thoughts on high fructose corn syrup because i feel like there is a lot of ignorance out there about it . okay , before the mid - 70s , ... sounds like me ! it seems like the older i get the more confident i become . i think that enfps are definitely optimistic and want to be confident and happy , but because they're so open to multiple ... i tend to not be extremely good at any few things but more adequately good at a bunch of things . i can basically pick up something new very quickly , and often develop a randomly intense focus on each ... i'm going to break the stereotype . female enfp - i love driving and am absolutely great at it . i actually think that whatever it is that makes enfps good at reading human body language can make ... i wouldn't buy one . i don't feel like it would be a good idea to report him though , especially because of the fact that he's in your friend circle . plus , it's a tough economy , and a lot of people ... my mother is the exact same freaking way ! ugh . i've had to develop the unfortunate habit of interrupting people in conversations , because if i hadn't learned to do that growing up i would never have ... hahahaha wow , that scene was pretty funny . it looks good . shankyou . : 3 you actually do sound more entj to me . maybe i was right with my first guess after all ! : laughing : have you read any of the type descriptions ? do you think that entj sounds right to you ? as much ... okay , i used to watch a lot of anime . since , i've kind of fallen out of it , but i've been pretty bored lately so i'm looking for some new good ones . a lot of the big robot battles bore me . naruto ... how organized are you ? if you're assigned a group project at school , do you tend to lead or tend to follow ? what's the best thing you enjoy doing in your free time ? how would you describe ... well , imagination is a bigger thing than just one function , but the main difference between entps and estps is that entps have ne and estps have se . if you don't know what i'm talking about , this ... * reads mind * entj ! actually i'd love to help , but i can't read minds . : tongue : can you say a little about yourself ? how do you deal with day-to-day life ? just curious here , what makes you think you're enfp ? a lot of the stuff in your first post made me think enfj , so i'm kind of surprised by your conclusion . don't get me wrong , i'm not trying to make ... http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2009/12/4/129044274684174271.jpg it's actually a lot harder to type in person than when simply reading a list of their thoughts online . at least , for me it is , because in order to really see someone's thought process you have to ... i second the isfp vote . you are definitely xnfp . you sound more infp than enfp in your post to me , but you didn't really mention how outgoing / social / outwardly focused you were . so where do you feel like your focus is - out ... that was a lot to read , and i tend to type better with thin slicing , but you totally seem isfj to me . i can explain if you want , but you should read some of the descriptions for that type and see ... estp is my guess . p . i like to think of it as procrastinator / perfectionist . while you do put things off , when you do them they have to be perfect ( as opposed to just getting them done ) .   ... i agree with everything that's been said already . just spend time with her and be sincere . don't worry so much about pleasing her . if you're true to yourself , that will please her . my parents were ... remember that nothing matters until you make it matter to yourself by caring about it . and when you care about it , you get over-controlling / uptight / worried . imagine yourself like a jellyfish . you ... so i am randomly motivated to lose weight . i am just slightly overweight , so some days i think it is the worst thing ever and other days i think no big deal i can start being healthy tomorrow . more ... i'm pretty sure my brother is an n ... though that might just be me projecting again . i always have a really hard time identifying sensors unless they're very strong . enfj actually sounds pretty spot ... if it's unexplainable , then it's probably more likely fi . as i understand it , fi makes decisions from things that aren't explainable or concrete , but you just get a feeling that it's the right thing ... so i had my mom take the test , and she was an enfp . it makes sense too , because we're a lot alike . my other family , i'm not super sure of . dad : very friendly , but sometimes unaware of more subtle ... have you ever thought that what you think is ti is actually you using te ? for a long time , i typed myself as entp because i am a very logical person and i excel in things like theory , math , ... so , for a long time i didn't know why i had trouble being in relationships . i simply found myself unable to stay with a guy after a certain point . i always came up with good reasons , but i understand ... after reading that , i think you're extroverted . so i'm changing my vote to estp . does that type sound right to you ? haha , your theories are cute . : happy : the way you described thinking of things is very s to me . for example , if i came across a book on landscape designing , whether or not i was planning on ... yay ! : blushed : it's not lame advice at all . i think just being there is how i've gotten as far as i have with her trust , so i understand it . if that's what she needs , i can definitely be there for ... this is awesome ! the way i've seen it , you istps tend to consider a lot of actions that are considered socially normal and even required to some , completely useless and unnecessary . you're not alone at all in your ... i don't really like either . i prefer it to be summer or winter . if it's not hot enough to go swimming in the river and not cold enough to go snowboarding , i don't like that season . : tongue : i have to agree with this . i'm definitely the kind of person to make a joke out of it rather than bring it up as some serious , sad thing . so most people don't even realize i'm suffering when i crack ... i'm no guy , but i've definitely experienced this . it's because only then do i start caring what the other person thinks . xd most of the time i could hardly care what comes out of my mouth ! apparently ... i'm sorry to hear about your loss . we go to different colleges so i haven't seen her enough to be sure , but i think she's staying in a lot more than usual . she's usually a pretty social person , ... i have a long-time friend who is an entj , and i love her to death . she's a great person to be with , and our friendship is very deep , but not in a direct way . we don't have gushy talk sessions ... i like facebook because of how much information you get about other people . i get to see pictures of my uncle visiting yellowstone while it's happening , and we can talk about it even though i ... you do seem very istp to me . : happy : i know you're asking for help , but have you tried looking into the types and seeing whether or not you relate to them ? i'm not much of a mind reader . so talk about yourself , how you act , what you ... i am a writing freak ! privately , haha . definitely agree about it being a place to get out fi . i love to journal for the emotional vent , but more lately i've been doing it just to remember stuff . i ... mbti is about personality ... and more specifically , about how your mind works . so while istps might be often physically adept , it won't always be the truth . what's more important is what functions ... D: well , that's certainly not how i picture myself ! and i think a lot of my friends would be absolutely floored if i had anything like that , hahaha . i'm a pretty simple person . i don't think type ... those moments where you have a random , deep connection with a stranger . and everything else that's been mentioned . : laughing : your childhood experiences remind me of myself ! i thought i was introverted for a long time , but looking back i think what really happened was because i was such an eager-to-please kid , i got picked ... yes ! i feel like this a lot . i mean , most of the time i actually am interested in what people are saying just because people themselves are interesting , but there are times when they start ranting ... do any of you have the problem of living too much in the possibilities of the future and failing to focus on the present ? i find i do . it's kind of ironic that i'll be dreaming of how clean and ... i think i've come to the conclusion that i'm an enfp . i watched how i act and think for a couple of days , and i think that's me . as much as there are parts of me that definitely make me consider infj ... see , i feel sort of borderline on this too . being around people does energize me , and if i'm having a stuck in the muck day , someone coming up and talking to me makes me forget about it and feel ... what , do only infps have dreams ? also , best avatar ever !
