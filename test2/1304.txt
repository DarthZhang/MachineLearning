great idea ! i would participate but youtube videos are not working for me at the moment :( creating something amazing is important for me . whatever i create will live on after i'm six feet under . how do much of priority do you put in having time to express yourself creatively ?

and what certain things do those people need to be your friends . i wrote down some of my ... one of my favorite poems , with many good quote by dana gioia entrance ( after rilke ) i know right ? im just working on getting my permit right now lol . im so lazy . most likely im going to go to a local junior college for 2 years then transfer . but yeah , its going to be a big step yeah , that's a plus . i wish i could do that , but its only about 4 months till school is over . ha . awesome ! yeah , i would like to do something like that actually , just doing some independent studies . hows that been for you ?
