' all introverts . personalized activities ( for any type ) for helping people when you want to see their reactions is voluntary work of any kind . in the long run those kinds of activities may even help you personally in ... nihilism is something i naturally gravitate towards , but consciously rebel against . life is much more interesting when you pretend there's meaning to it . i don't really experience emotions . except when i do . when i do , i don't handle them well . my typical reaction is to withdraw into solitude , where i don't have to deal with them anymore . i have been ... faking emotion when i don't have one is something that i haven't really tried so far . and i have found that usually it's not mandatory . you can't really change who you are . if you don't feel ... one of the very few clear intp villains i know is dr . herbert west from re-animator . he's kind of a douche , but not exactly evil . he's not interested in power or money or fame . in fact his basic ... you seem a lot more like entp to me . first off , when you regard a stereotypical enfp as rather stupid right off the bat , it tells me you don't really value fi . secondly , people with thinking ... and on the other hand , intp might be looking for a practical application as well . as i said , the difference is not that easy to point out , it's more like what they naturally prefer . istps may be ... okay . sorry that i'm late , but i've had a lot of things on my plate lately . hopefully i'm not too late , and you get to see my analysis . intp's are never bossy , not even the females . and rarely ... eleven . but reading your responses again , i might have been in too much of a hurry voting for this one . most of your responses could be either or , but on closer read you do seem to be leaning a bit ... exactly . there are always a few inches between the tall and short categories , where you fall on average . you sound like infp to me . you know for sure you have fi - that's dom or aux . you have quite a bit of si ? oh well - istj is possible but doesn't sound too likely . that's infp-typical chapter . yeah . infj , perhaps . i believe you to be intp and have voted so . a quick read says entp . i can also make a more thorough analyze if requested ( and if i happen to be around for it ) . in fact tall ( for men ) is above 6 feet and short below 5 ' 5 ' ' . anything in between is just average . you come off as very entj to me . do you want me to dissect every answer you just gave ? almost all of them will spell heavy entj to me . well , that kind of sounds like me - an intp . and i also like to be active at times , it's just that i usually need a conscious effort to do so . the difference is not that easy to point out really . the ... not necessarily . i am an intp who for a long time thought i was istp because i had learned to value istp ways to deal with the world . i still do , but i have learned the difference between se and ne ... i don't do this . if i've spent this much time and effort to a post , i figure i should just post it . i might cut it shorter than initially intended if i get bored . i would lean more towards entp as well . you do have the typical entp sarcastic streak , it's evident even when you try to suppress it . you do not sound like istj at all . si-dominants do not come off as weird at all , and it would be a disaster for them if they did , they would not advertise themselves as weird . a good tell for esfjs and enfjs ( fe-dominants ) is that they are very expressive , you can actually see the fe-dominance in their face . think delta goodrem , think sarah palin . google some of their ... he does sound very istpish . i think it's very common for istps to mistype as intp and vice versa , because of the ti-dominance . what makes these two types different starts with auxiliary function , ... you have very good points here . isfp is also a strong possibility . but fi-dominant for sure . not really sure why , but this answer immediately made me think of infp . fi . fi . i believe we have just reached gender equality . istp it could be then . i think you should go along with that until / unless something convinces you otherwise . isxps don't necessarily crave extreme sports , although that's the stereotype . your sister definitely has the ixfp thing going on , and after careful reading i will say isfp as well . here's the tell : ... what i glean from this is , he probably does not have romantic feelings for you at the moment ; or at least , isn't aware of them . that doesn't mean it can't happen , only that you need to have the ... the best advice i can give you is not to be too hard on yourself and forgive yourself whatever you think you might be faulty of . but i'm probably not the best authority to tell anyone anything . keep ... ne-heavy personalities are very facetious . se-heavy personalities too , but to a lesser degree , and they often copy from ne-users . but from my experience se-heavies do appreciate facetious humor and ... at first i tested out as intp , and was happy with that for a while . until i started to speculate and made some more tests where i came out intp , istp , intj or istj . so i joined some intp community to ... could be . but i'm not going there right now , i only just came back after a few weeks break . ask her out . with your smartphone , no less . if it's a no , move on . i mean that your repressed ( inferior , 4th ) function will often show as the least developed function in tests - because you are repressing it . if your strongest functions don't give enough clues , i ... the key here , i think , is your repressed ne . everything else is kind of average , except your seemingly high fi . but i know high si can easily look like fi in tests . celebritytypes test is bad . they measure se by value questions , and that's not a good way to measure it . your results in k2c are much more in line what i saw in your questionnaire . which test did you take ? if you take tests , i recommend keys 2 cognition . but don't put too much faith into online tests . if you mean attention to one's own appearance , i think both se and si are ... isfj or maybe esfj . 1-2 ) nothing . 3 ) ah-ha ! definitely si-heavy . could be inferior ti here . i don't know much about enneagram , but just read about type 1 . if you really think you're type 1 , either your si is very well-developed indeed or you might want to consider istj . i see intp . intp is the one to constantly second-guess their type , and they can get easily stressed and be hard on themselves too . i know i am . i would guess enfj more likely . this is very much fe in the first slot . fi doesn't really care about upsetting other people , if what they have to say is in line of their own moral ... it depends on the goal you want finished ... but if you want to have it finished and there's a deadline , i'd just start and push and push until it's over . start today . put everything else out of the ... who wants to be healthy ? health is overrated . intp , yes . op , will you marry me ? okay then . seems like an ne-heavy thing to say . entp is my first impression . then i get the very same impression from all the other responses , and post it as my verdict . but she wants to know ... as long as you're fairly certain of this , i would go with infp . so fi-dom then , infp or isfp . you relate to si , but seems to me much less than to fi . this would make me think infp . i haven't read your other threads though , so isfp could it be too . introverted .
