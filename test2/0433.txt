' and just to think i tripped , stumbled and fell into this thread . carry on folks ! ( yes i'm a klutz and a halfu 200b ) aproaches we're masters of digging ourselves out of our own grave . you know , the one we constantly put ourselves into . for the most part it does , although i believe some character roles were shuffled around to add more drama . its fairly accurate , although any movie adaptation tends to leave out tidbits here and ... well i wouldn't have divulged so much information or pursued the idea without a speculative investment on my part . although i am not actively searching for a girlfriend or companion at the time , she ... this is hilarious . a few months ago i was searching for a bunch of movies with the parameters thought provoking movies , which inevitably led me to the intj forum . i had my way with their ... brb , devising a super elaborate code cracking algorithm for this ultra complex equation that is known as ni-fi . thank you for your contribution , lily . take away their bong . likewise . i've found it very hard for myself to maintain an emotional bond to an individual and have let down a lot of people in the process . its not exactly a task for me to communicate with women , ... answering in your particular order : - a straight answer was elusive here , but i understand that intjs respond best with very direct questions . i will certainly ask again though . - i have ... i think she's trying to get a rise out of me . the problem with this sort of one-upsmanship is that i can spot it from a mile away . she seems a bit put off because last night i told her she needs to ... in my most recent days i have seemed to discover an intj female with a personally insurmountable amount of depth in any female i have ever encountered in my entire life . it began on another ... wtf @ your username . lmfao no , i'm neither . i'd enjoy having to dispose of the bodies of those who think i am . i mean really , how can someone so attractive do such a thing ? i love cats . there aren't enough words to describe how much fun i'd have at one of these . a coffee and a cat ? brilliant ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPbgkhpR3PI.swf this doesn't happen to me , rather , i get bored of most girls i meet and only the ones that seem worth my time get my unwarranted attention . its kind of like seeing a golden opportunity , only to prove ... introvert , extravert . pish posh . you all still run to the bathroom when you gotta go . pfft , humans ( or should i say animals ? ) . are you saying that n types reproduce more n types by nature ? this is absurd . to some of the more matured entps , i have a few questions . when did you begin developing your fe-si ? i mean genuinely , where it started to impact your outlook on life and how you handle it ? ... well , that escalated quickly . i confess that i was a less than ideal mate for my ex girlfriend . far too selfish , abrasive , controlling , and inflexible . she might have made a good decision to sever ties with me . i don't know . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsboPUjrGc.swf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX6XMIldkRU.swf i kind of admire the arrogance and confidence that most intjs i have personally met tend to exhibit . this sort of mystifies their image . in contrast to an intp , the intj is not as much an open book ... engage engage , and engage some more . then follow them home and engage on the way . works every time ! i also have this really annoying high pitched ho ho ho ! laugh that i use at the end of any ... one of those signs that chauffeurs use when picking up a foreign passenger at the airport . im currently in a starbucks with an ambitiously colorful sign that reads infj ? ! and a winky smile just ... : laughing : that was brilliant . i don't know how to take this in my day-to-day , as my coldness has netted me a plethora of single-serving interactions that ended up in my favor yet contributed to some of my most catastrophic losses ... heliotrope i guess from the surface most would identify me as a libertarian . i'm fairly socially liberal with some considerations for conservative convention , and fairly economically ... one night i decided to apply as a volunteer canvasser for the conservative party of canada and the liberal party of canada at the same time . both replied , but the cons had a much better canvass route ... i've done political canvassing in the past , but something tells me that the camp i supported wouldn't have many infjs , let alone nfs for that matter : laughing : . as for volunteering , its something ... i thought this was , for the lack of a better word , cute . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GT3ZiBMgXA.swf it really depends where one would fall on the quality of human interaction scale . i'll use real-life interaction for my basis . for single-serving social interactions , trust is not something that ... racism would imply selective hatred . therefore , intjs are not racist . http://i46.tinypic.com/35jzg5e.jpg i think i read about those in a textbook once . i'd like someone to compile a universal formula of x = howdoesthatmakefuckingsense . you can use exponents , the cosine ratio , and the divine graces of multitheistic gods ( yes i said that in the intp ... its rather selfish to assume that our days are the only ones that are relevant . once the earth purges it's noncontributing consumers , perhaps the cosmos will rotate a little more freely . i don't see why a relationship should exist without exclusivity . you make perfect sense . i refer to crap-shoot relationships ( one that doesn't clearly define a future objective , ie . long term ... after my post i just had to google entp vampire , and of course , a thread about entp trustworthiness popped up from intjforum , lol . yes . because we are all incapacitated quadriplegics when the sun's rays beam down on earth . it took me a devastating loss in my life to recognize the hurt one can inflict on a significant other when you don't pay attention to them . the special kind of attention . i felt as if i had to one-up ... ah , the elusive infj female . seldom heard or seen , but quite possibly the most illuminating persona to encounter . no , i'm not generalizing , i'm just trying to prove myself right ( or wrong , but so ... i guess opposites attract , hence the two posts meeting on the same thread . we have uncovered the meaning of life - - everything isn't and at the same time , is . because its the opposite of why isn't life . or maybe misplaced , malicious fe . i'm excellent at acquiring friends and impressing people , but my long-term relationships suck ass . i once introspected that fear was the fundamental motivator to many facets of successful living . it has stuck with me since . hold on here while i try to process this . entps , commitment ?
