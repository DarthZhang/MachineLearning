' hang out with people who are strong fe users , it'll come naturally . try to pick balanced ones though i beg to differ , the only time the ni-ti loop could be described as a conspiracy theory generator is when a person is fighting there insecurities . i find that my ni-ti loop is very accurate and ... lol ! making you look smart ? not even i can do that ;) they're both processing modes for when we run out of energy , to avoid just make sure you always have energy in reserves and aren't overburdening yourself in any way . to engage go on a massive fe / se ... this is actually me acceptance , i've seen entp's on both side of the equation and helped some go from anxious and uncertain to social monsters , it just came down to giving them pure 100 % acceptance . extroverted feelers ... haha ! are you sure its a matter of lines getting crossed or just us getting side tracked with our own little worlds and forgetting to return for awhile ? i know i love the entp forum and it's the ... takes a bit of fine tuning and can be hard to get of the ground but if your willing to take the time and allow us in it's an incredible dynamic . you've got to investing in to the friendship first , ... estj and infj or estj and infj ( which is actually infp by mbti ) . i wouldn't recommend infj from experince . can't speak for infj's ( infp's ) i used to have male entp's appear whenever i tried to make fireworks or blow things up in general . is there a female equivalent ? ( entp's and fireworks is like cheese and whine ) i'd rather be corrected and look stupid then live a life of ignorance , so if there's any more info awesome . lol ! sorry no i'm genuine . sarcasm is not really my thing . really ? how peculiar , i've honesty never meet anyone who fully understood socionics or been able to explain it , even those that have preach to me about . if thats the case are we talking about a entp or entp my advice is experiment it's the only true way to know . infj's make awesome partners provided there self esteem hasnt been majorly damaged but then again what temprement isnt painful when having a ... haha ! yes socionics ... it's a load of fairy dust . wait does that make you a part of the 3 % just now ;) as an infj i read people really well , there's only one temprement i would consider better at picking up on emontions and being aware of people thats enfj's . the issue with most enfj's is they lack ... with enfj's messy rooms tend to be a reflection of a lower self esteem or large amounts of stress , saying they have there own system is only a justification . entp's are awesome in creating left of ... haha ! as much as i am willing to whore my avatar and sig out it still has to be somewhat representitive of me but you're welcome to take a try . it kind of sounds like your husband had a lack in confidence / low self esteem and a lot of pride . people who are insecure tend to build up a lot of pride as crazy as that may seem . it's like a over ... you're awesome ! istp's can read ! ? ! ;) istp's speak ! ? ! ;) lol ! yeah that happens to me all the time to . ( it almost happened twice just then ... ) so i came home from work today made a call to my sister who i haven't spoken to in about a week , midway throught the conversation she had to do something , leaving me with a few minutes to fill in . so ... hi to me ... haha ! possible , sorry . no problem'o . a statistical impossibility is a probability that is so low as to not be worthy of mentioning . sometimes it is quoted as 1x10 ^ - 50 [ 1 ] although the cutoff is inherently ... lol , thank - you for your reassurance , i'm quite comfortable in myself , my sexuality and my ability to talk to and attract girls . don't get me wrong mind connection is important but i'm just not ... a couple of good documentaries to start with are ' elegant universe ' and ' down the rabbit hole ' , the deeper you go the more design the universe seems to have . not to mention evolution is a statistical ... i read somewhere that infj's males are gay . it was news to me ... waiting ... waiting ... nope still attracted to females ... maybe i'm secretly female ... .. hmmm ... you guys looked much into quantum physics ? sounds like you have a nasty rut . challeng yourself ! look up quantam physics , debate with a friend , what makes you tick . are you lacking in the having i depth conversations about random stuff ... yeah i blame the axe ... fi is an interesting function , it can be a blessing or a curse from what i've seen basically in life you've got to learn the difference between what's yours to take on ... i also do the dishes foe fun and sometimes i even remember to shave my face to ! ! wait ! ? ! selling me ! ? ! this is even lower then when you tried sending back to the hospital and when you hit me with ... you mean is it true that all infj are incredible good looking , then yes we are :) for all other questions i'd refer you to this guy .   ... does that inculde asking for help with multiple things ? eg . car issues , pc issues ( which both times the flatemate / best friend is more the capable of solving ) . team work is generally great as long as both are mature and neither becomes convinced of there moral surperriority . still personally i'd prefer to work with nt's , less messy and although not always ... really ? strange i've never really seen an infj tack offence to an enfp and i know a lot of both . actually i don't think i've seen many take offence to enfp's who weren't xsxx . who's doing ... i'm self employed , it's awesome . being an infj don't expect to get rich , i find i frequently underchange in order to help people out but at the same time a lot of people come back to me because i ... in my younger days definitely , but not anymore . i've had plenty of interest from girls lately but i think i like my life to much the way it is having said that in more recent times there's been a ... there's plenty of shy extroverts out there , being confident and being extroverted are two completely different things . it someone grows up in a house hold where they are constantly being attacked ... 6 ' 1 been this height since about 14 years old i've actually seen a few entp's get miss typed for infj's , generally they've been suppressed in childhood or earlyteens in some way . entp's are social engineers and so if developed right have similar ... i refuse to touch the stuff after watching the long term effects on my flatemates and family , that stuff plays with your brain chemistry , its kind of like anti-depressant and alcohol the user ... wait wouldn't that be a secret weapon better used against an entp army ! ? ! must be a global bad time of the month for estj's , from my experience this happens every now and then depending on the alignments of the moon and planets . 24 and growing younger every day bow ? that really depends on the quality and quantity of ice cream your offering but i'm up for negotiation .
