( my ex . ) i don't find this topic depressing . death is waiting everyone of us , and we have to accept it as much as we can . i've read somewhere that people cannot completely accept death , there's always that ... i think that basketball would help you while you were a child , but i'm not sure if it would help now . i'm 5ft and 9 inches , but everyone in my family is tall , and serbs are tall in general . i am an intp , but i always isolate myself . actually , i isolate myself everyday , i need an hour - minimum , or even more , to spend alone , just thinking or listening to music . extroverts usually don't ... i don't drink alcohol , soda , or anything like that . i love water and every possible juice , black tea , coffee ( it's not very healthy , but it's not very healthy being a student , too :) ) walking in dark streets with a friend of mine , i love those long walks at night , listening some piano , taking a slow shower , drinking hot milk ... ivana . it's made of male name ivan , it is a hebrew word and means ' ' god is beneficial ' ' . in serbian , my native , it's written in this way ' ' ивана ' ' . samhain , i don't know where you've read it . i've talked about this to a cousin of mine , a veterinarian , and he told that it's even rare in fauna . i don't support them and i never will , i think it's it's some kind of a disease , although modern doctors are claiming other things . but for me it will never be something normal . but , i also think ... i like both of them , day and night , but i don't like that period early , early in the morning , about 5 o'clock , i wake up in that period and it makes me depressive somehow . i was lazy to read all the posts , so i may say again something that's already said . in that case , sorry . anyway , i do talk to myself when i alone . it started when i was about 6 , i think . first it ... i have a terrible headache whole day , but i'm so happy . well , i obviously realized the topic in the wrong way . regards every time , but every f * cking time a guy start flirting with me , i think he just wants sex . generally , that's my opinion about every man . lies by itself are not good , especially if you want to make a good relations with your family members , partners , friends etc . i would feel guilty if i would try lying them . but i can lie other ... it's weird , but i was dreaming that it was early in the morning , on the street , in front of a book store , and the street was wet . i was walking down the street and than a man started chasing me . ... fate , i cannot tell that . i have to say that i've been feeling flattered , but it was all disgusting and shallow . me and them , we were all shallow in my eyes . i rarely show my emotions , to be sincere , it's so boring and pathetic . if a friend of mine , for example , knows how much i love her by spending time with her , being with her , she doesn't need words . i'm an introvert , but i can act like i'm not , that's probably why i was popular in high school . but i knew it was not ok , i was popular for something i haven't been strugling to get , i had it since i ... i love the smell of it , it's so energetic , i drink it once a week , i would never let myself being addicted . ludovico einaudi - una matina . i'm on last.fm , that means - too lazy to open youtube and to put the song here . :D very well . somehow , everyone , especially stupid persons , think how their opinion is important so they have to tell everyone everything about it . i don't have a problem with it , but it can't change ... i don't know if this is some kind of paranoia , but i have some fears for a long time . sometimes , especially in the night , while i'm walking alone down the street , i'm sure that somebody is watching ... my nightmare became truth three years after dreaming it . damn , i still cannot understand it . i like meeting new people , i always hope that i will find somebody like me . there's a reason for it , that's how i've found my best friend . church , books , family . well , if you ask me if i would like being homeless but with somebody i love or being rich with somebody i don't - the answer is - i would choose nothing of those . it's more complexed than it seems ... agent blackout , the point of my life is not to desire whatever i want to desire . i've just realized how shallow my desires are . facepalm . i don't meet them in real life , just through internet . i know , that's sad . when i can't have something , i usually convince myself that is not so important and i don't need it . and i find another thing to want . right now i would eat some milk chocolate , but i can , tomorrow ... i particularly understand you . but for me , it's bit different . i make a board between myself and rest of the world and , somehow i find myself thinking and living in my own world ( read : my head ) . so , ...
