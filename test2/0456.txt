' used to be kind of , not really anymore . but in general i can see it . i don't mean that the questionnaire completely changed my perception of social , necessarily , or that it's completely accurate . i just meant that some of the questions showed me some things that i ... good test ! i got 13 social , 23 self-pres , and 32 sexual . in particular i think this helped me understand exactly what the social variant is somewhat more , because i've classified myself as social in ... the test itself , in my opinion , is pretty good , but it's not the best enneagram test i've taken . one of the things that i do like is that it gives results for every type preference , so that you can ... 1w9 : easier to get along with and have more quiet strength , whereas 1w2 seems too controlling . 2w3 : same deal , i don't like how the 2w1 might try to convince me to do more things whereas the 2w3 ... a lot of this depends on the context of the situation for me - for example , i might love to work with some type but find them frustrating to deal with in a more casual situation . that being said , ... this is a pretty interesting idea . i will say that i have always found it somewhat strange that type 6 has phobic and counterphobic variations ( which are present in basically every piece of ... we're not necessarily trying to imply that it's restricted to introverts , just that that's what we've observed more of . i guess i should elaborate more on how i think this works . part of this ... so the question becomes , do any of you reading this see how this might be true ? have you had experiences that might go along these lines ( or provide evidence to the contrary ) ? as someone who's ... there's a fairly long list , including : i don't particularly like professional critics ( any field , really ) because i think that the idea that most people look for the same things in their ... some new boots . yeah , that's kind of what i was saying . about blackberries , i mean . for me , part of the reason that i like autumn is that it's nice and temperate . things aren't too wet ( winter , spring ) or humid ... yeah , autumn is my favorite season too , by a pretty wide margin . yeah * winces * , i've been there ... and , i don't really ... i guess i don't see blackberries as distant enough to be the ... : l i dunno about that , man . i hear we're kinda stringy . fruits , if you can dig it . a little more expansion on why i think of five as an apple ... so , if we consider the apple , the first thing that comes to mind for me is its crispness . apples have an audible ' snap ' when you bite ... eh , that's some good reasoning - i can see where you're coming from . the last part is a bit arguable though , because we see that he has a very clear idea of what ( he thinks ) the consequences will be ... not , perhaps , the intention we had in mind , but hey , if it works ... okay , i see where you're coming from . i generally go with infj for him , but that could partly be personal bias on my part . part of the issue is that we don't know how much of what he does is his true ... so you've already talked about this some ( raspberries being 4 ) , but i just thought i'd try to clarify for anyone watching . so a big part of the logic here is that the 4 is typically seen as romantic , ... mostly i agree , but what makes you see koizumi as an intp ? i became a vegetarian when i first learned what meat was ( around the age of 3 ) . i was fundamentally disturbed by the idea of eating something that had been an animal ( i had a lot of fears as a little ... it is rather ... unnerving at times . one of the things i'm glad about ( retroactively ) is that i became a vegetarian early , so i didn't have the moment of oh god what is this when i learned about the ... my father is not employed , but it's not for lack of skill or ambition . he decided to be a stay at home dad when i was young ( i'm 18 now ) , and now he's mired himself in chores and the like ( our house ... i usually try to be nice or deflect the question ... not overly so , you understand . i'm not going to get really hyped up about how attractive a person is ( maybe even if they really are ) , but i might ... magenta is not a color i dunno , i don't have this as much ... then again , i'm a very literary person , so it wouldn't surprise me if words ( names ) stuck with me more than most people . people can change their avatars when they ... yeah , you kind of develop a feel for what's legit and what looks like a cover for making a quick buck after a while . that's all i can say - you come to know with experience . find some master internet ... i guess i'm not really sure where the cutoff between being interested and being a fan is precisely , but i'd say i'm a fan of mostly a lot of anime ( gurren lagann , lucky star , darker than black , ... mostly i agree with what's been said so far - while there may be correlations , it's more of an individual thing than any kind of hard and fast rule . so what i wanted to add here is , you're grouping ... boss : okay , good . just wanted to make sure . your point about personal preference is certainly true - biologically , certain people enjoy the taste of meat more than others , and i doubt that would ... just to expand a little more on the idea of cherry as 1 - i see the core as very representative of the repressed emotions , in particular anger , that a 1 can have . 1 ' s try to be pure and moral , but a ... i'm a type 1 ( we think , i've changed my views on this a couple of times ) and i have mixed feelings . on the one hand , i do like the system and how it describes motivations and lets people see more ... we may switch 5 and 6 - apples have more of that crispness going on , which can maybe fit with the way that 5 ' s can be kind of detached and precise . in my mind , the reasoning for 9 as strawberry goes something like this : first , it doesn't seem like strawberry is as polarizing of a fruit as a lot of fruits are , which fits with the idea of ... boss - yeah , i wasn't trying to say it was caused by type or anything like that , just that it seemed like there could be some interesting connections due to type motivations . i'm also not trying to ... i know a guy who we think is so / sp . i think some of what people said is probably true , though : sx's are seen as more dynamic than other types , more flashy , which is something that is very ... so it occurred to me that there might be some correlation between enneagram type and the prevalence of vegetarianism / veganism . respond to the poll with your type and whether you are or not , and feel ... okay , i guess i'll challenge you for it then . if you win , you get to destroy the world and i'll go live somewhere else . but if i win , you have to make me an internet sandwich . history of the sieve chocozuma's revenge yes , you really can do that . definitely getting an sp vibe . istp ? i'm terrible at strategy games like chess . i also sometimes wonder if i'm too feely to be an intj - if i feel and enjoy feeling too much . i'm pretty confident that i'm at least inxj , though ; i have ... because i love crossover memes . generally , i like anime quite a lot . but it still has to be good . i would say that my five favorite anime are probably tengen toppa gurren lagann , darker than black , lucky star , fullmetal ... lucky star : konata izumi : entp kagami hiiragi : estj tsukasa hiiragi : isfp miyuki takara : isfj yui narumi : esfp nanako kuroi : intp ? yutaka kobayakawa : infp minami iwasaki : istj ? ( isfj ? ) ... hisao : varies some based on arc , but i can see infj . i definitely saw misha as an esfp ... i feel like she very definitely has se ( savors sensations as opposed to si , which merely categorizes them ) ... not math . but i should be . yeah , yeah , i'm 18 . i also know another dude on here who's 17 , but i won't divulge his identity .
