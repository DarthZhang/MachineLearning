my favourite ( at the moment ) would be light yagami because he is intelligent and not an emotional train wreck ... oh don't get me wrong , he did some things that really pissed me off for example , laughing on l grave . i like l too , i just like light more . about the percentage , it was just something that stuck in ... i criticize you for taking this seriously . the whole thread is supposed to be a joke . i would also like to point out that your criticize is invalid because the title clearly states that you should ... ah ... yes the l sit . i do believe he said his reasoning ability increased by 40 % i'm not sure why i exactly remember that , i favor light more . i've always liked light . i liked him before i found ... i think the reason so many people chose l as their avatar , is because he is such a strong intp . maybe you didn't notice , but if you search my type , intj a lot of pictures of light show up . i would ... for shame . i criticize you for using a sentence fragment . ^ i criticize you for being an sj in an nt forum not me ... i promise . yes people are stupid , and we ( or maybe just i ) are negative to them . however , when it comes to life situations , i'm generally more of a realist . but most of the time the most rational expectation is ... this is funny because my nickname is kaaarl ! xd [ quote = sapphire 90 ; 1092778 ] being one of the few intj women out there , i've often found befriending people difficult in general - specifically other females . i wonder if it's because i'm not really in ... it's probably pretty obvious , but my sister is deductivereasoner ( an entp ) . she is my closest and one of my few companions . personally , i am better off single . all relationships i've been in have ended up in arguing and ending the dumb thing because they got over emotional from the fact that i wasn't always feeling ... i will listen to just about anything except country . although rap does get a little annoying whenever the lyrics are just about strippers and drugs . but some songs are okay . touche . i hate it when sensors can't connect dots . at any rate , why would a sensor dare try to understand the amazingness of an intj ? how is that judgement not belittling ? and just to clear up the confusion about the definition of arrogance , the websters unabridged dictionary ( yes i do own one of those ) states : arrogance , ... i have an extreme dislike for the three . and anything ingested orally , could be considered to have been eaten . i stated i was a picky eater , especially when it comes to bacon , pickles , and lemonade ... only if it's about trivial things that do not matter . work : student hobbies : gaming , anime , music , japan , gaming , plotting vengeance partnerships : i don't really know yet . food : i'm a relatively picky eater . particularly towards bacon , pickles , and ... i have to agree with you . it is a free country , so technically a person can commit suicide if they really felt the need . however , i have never personally seen someone so miserable with their life ... i'm a kingdom hearts fan , because of the storyline . i like the fact that organization xiii doesn't have feelings because then they don't make stupid emotional decisions .. i'm a big zelda fan , too . my ... i'm not too sure how this is related to mbti , but whatever . my hair is dark brown ( almost black and yes this is natural ) , a little past my shoulders , and straight with side bangs that usually cover ... no i honestly don't consider myself to have any phobias , but those would be the things that make me the most uncomfortable . haha would my excitement make more sense if i told you that my entp sister ( deductivereasoner ) wrote this ? i love those words ( especially floccinaucinihilipilification ) . another one of my favorite words is defenestration : the act of throwing someone or something out of a window . xd throughout my avid dictionary scouring , i came across a hilarious word that makes me laugh every time i say it : hippophile ( one who loves horses ) . what are some words that make you other intj's laugh ? overpass-ophobia , and feeler phobia ... seriously those people creep me out . i like zelda because i love the way the puzzles in it make me think ... although the whole water temple then fire temple then forest temple then spirit temple thing gets pretty reptitive . i'm a ... my personal interests range from trashy novels to young adult vampire romance novels . just kidding . i like sci fi , mystery , encyclopedias and dictionaries . i'm also rather fond of mangas , if that ... ... i don't . when you hide behind bookshelves to keep yourself from not just being talked to , but to keep from being seen too . ( yes i have done this ... on multiple occations . ) the jokes of my entp sister , listening to music , watching anime / reading manga , and scheming against whatever put me in a bad mood in the first place . i play the alto saxophone . however , i have taught myself a few simple songs on piano and would love to get better at it . i know exactly how you feel . i get you don't have to be so rude about it as a response all the time . my best friend is my older sister . she is an entp . ... when you don't go out in public because you can't stand society . ^ _ ^ even if she can be a little sensitive , one of my very best friends ( it's not like i actually have that many best friends ) is an infj . she's really outgoing , but can get a little self conscience . i have been told multiple time that i am heartless , have no sense of humour , am to smart / computer / robot , and quiet . there have been some people that have thought i was a mute , but they were ... i'm an ntj and the only person who has been able to beat me at chess was my older sister who strangely enough , is an ntp . quite a few things piss me off . however , they would all lead up to the stupidity of some people . people that argue over stupid stuff , and don't even have a rational excuse for arguing are the worst ... hi sister ! ! ^ _ ^ well ... in my family there are only 2 nts out of five . those people would be you and i hahaha ! ! ! i'm new ! and an intj ! hi ! that is all .
