' now say that last line out loud : laughing : i'm an ixfj magnet . close friends throughout life have been : isfj , isfj , isfj , infj , infj , estj , and intp i must look like a drowning puppy with my sad fi feels probably the most meaningful ... i believe there is another thread where you are supposed to criticize the poster above you . the theme of this thread is the poster's type . if you get the ideas confused you might come across as ... i could be an entp too , if i did the right drugs imagine a single intj father trying to raise three sf children ( esfj , esfp . and isfp ) who have been indoctrinated to rebel in their earlier , more influential years by a contemptful enfp mommy ... 84907 this is supposed to be an insult , but also not ? we're all insecure infp , i thought you were okay with that . don't tell me you'd abandon your humanistic ideals so easily because you got mad ? 84904 robots ... are cute ... : blushed :: blushed :: blushed : ha , we are not typically rebellious . it just seems that way because you've only experienced their response to an sj presence , which is universal among all other temperaments : wink : and now the entp is trying to be an infj . i knew deep down you guys must have been hiding some insecurity : tongue : i understand , head up a * * is impairing . but i'm going to have to ask you to write your wrong and reply to the poor isfj above you . being the saint that i am , i will let it slide this time . a well rounded entp could profit from both , but that's not the jab i was trying to make . who cares about sincerity ? typically people who hold a certain standard for themselves and other people . you ... that's not a very sincere attitude , you guys profit off of that kind of thing . apparently i'm not the only one afraid to hurt your feelings . infp makes a post and the thread comes to a halt : rolleyes : maybe if you would pull your head out of your sugar scented a * * you would ... i never realized the true importance of that movie until now . an istp probably relates to him on a personal level and looks to the grinch as a source of inspiration . so if the grinch is an entp with ... infp , i don't even want to insult you , i'm afraid you'll never get over it . that was pathetic , i know :( but i really didn't want to ( i already project fi onto other people , that it might hold ... wow , didn't think an entp could express beyond 84900 i learn new things everyday :) isfp compulsive nihilistic atheist , dweller and fearer of death and emptiness . i would like to believe in something , watching movies helps . a . enfj b . esfj c . intj i don't much like these options . any feeling dominant interaction is just too much feels . i get sick of myself ... but still can't stop from perpetuating the cycle . even ... no , i don't think you could scare her away with that :) good luck i think sps are programmed to live in anarchy . we might live significantly more successful lives in an apocalypse than the current , at least compared to other temperaments . ( i'm just going to make fun of your avatar instead . cool ? ) if that isn't some ridiculously complex , alienated from reality , and possibly pretentious ni dom symbolism than you must just have ... it's up to you to make that call . like i said , an isfp may be overwhelmed by extravagant displays , we tend to stay on the edge of things and like to feel some measure of control over how involved we ... ya'll are cool but i think we hail from planets : wink : it's just , i'm drawn to ixxps because they look like me . and then i expect them to be like me , but nope hahaha any type that uses different functions from me . intps , like what ? : confused : estps having fun together ; the ritualistic hunting and killing displayed by pack predators . somebody should hurry up and make a national geographic special about you guys ;P i live in a cave if upset i'll eat you up because i love food : cool : isfp : cool : generally isfps are laid back but can be overwhelmed by other people easily , consequentially getting scared off . ease into it , it should be pretty obvious if she likes your company or not , especially ... anybody else remember this show ? i've been thinking about this all day , these are my conclusions malcolm - intp or intj depending on occasion . reese - he looks like an esxp but he isn't . clear ... mysterious ? intps also other isfps , for totally different reasons . i can read an istp like a book . it's almost scary being alone with one because i feel like there is an air of vulnerability ... welcome karoh ! always nice to see another sj joining the forums , you guys can be kind of underrepresented here . if you're still trying to determine your type i suggest taking a close look at the ... online : * trys to contribute to forums * everything i type sounds like garbled gibberish with real people : * trys to speak * everything i say is like literal garbled gibberish :( ( ( sp when asked to explain themselves : * scoops up your girl / boyfriend bridal style , hops on the motorcycle and rides off into the sunset laughing the whole way * i was just thinking about tropes and mbti types . what kind of protagonist would each of the mbti types be ? infjs and istps seem to be pretty common , so i already have a few thoughts on those ... that signature is so quintessentially estp :P yet esfp for being sparkly i'm stumped * shrugs * enfj for being cryptic ? nobody knows an estp better than an infj entp for enjoying banter with an intp :) lgbt = rainbow = enfp awww , tsundere . you're still estjing : kitteh : estj , stop your estjing ! isfp colour wheel : blushed :: blushed : umf entp , because if you were entp that would be a very entp way of indirectly complimenting yourself isfj for being so considerate :) intp for black and white avatar you know , he kind of looks like an enfp too ( just the avatar . i don't watch doctor who ) with the colours . so i pick that . am i still allowed to mistype someone as their own type ? :P celticanoir istp , because i keep wanting to say istp for you . it's your avatar , it looks like an istp protagonist isfj , for double response ( an effort to make everybody involved ) :P intj , because you had it all planned out from the beginning . :P esfj because you can't type titties without the disclaimer apostrophes .
