' i personally see her as an isfp , however i could see infp i see ! my blog is make me a phanwich hi ! :D sure , my blog is make me a phanwich i'm following you now ! :D i joined the twitter phandom first , then i joined the tumblr - i now prefer the tumblr ! even though i joined the phandom ' officially ' late last year as this was when i opened all of my social media ... could not agree any more ! :) no way ! ! ! just like me ! ! ! haha phandom buddy :D are you / were you part of the twitter or tumblr phandom ? or both ? :) i think he's one of those very difficult people to type ! after a lot of thought , i'm now pretty sure on isfp yes ! ! ! are you part of the phandom , like me , by any chance ? ! no , that is nothing to do with intuition ! read this , it's from a credible source : the myers & briggs foundation - sensing or intuition it's the very basics , but should give you a better idea . ... true , maybe she feels that she is an introvert because she has some very extroverted friends ( joey and shane , for example ) , and may feel like she is a lot quieter and less sociable than them , hence ... i think catrific said in her isfj video that her sister is an isfj , so maybe she could have had some strong family influence with her type ? i'm not sure about it all , really ! it is certainly a possibility , however , i do still feel than dan is a ne-dom . yes , phil is pretty much a textbook-male infp :) from my own experience , they completely ignore and blank you , and when you ask what is wrong , they go all uncomfortable and defensive yes , i'm friends with one but we're not particularly close . i empathise completely what type do you believe she is ? :) yes , he certainly does immature fe ! i have no idea where it was from , but i remember seeing a video of him or something saying how much of a better person he was when he was in his twenties compared ... well i'm just feeling anxiety at the moment for my exam result tomorrow and in september i'm starting the most stressful academic year of my life :( when i initially started thinking about what dan's type could be , infp was actually my first thought , but that was just a very very subjective decision of mine - i literally just based this off of the ... there is a whole entire thread for dan . i strongly , strongly support the idea that dan is an entp and phil is an infp hmm , yes ! ;) and he definitely never seems to reply to the same tweet more than once , and it's always with a closed off statement / answer ! :( haha yes ! :) but on the comments on his tweet saying that , i was honestly surprised at how many people actually knew of the personality typing theory ! i totally didn't expect that ... okay . so i'm just gonna say it , and say that the majority of people who say that their type is something , and yet they seemingly have no idea of even the last two letters , i can sure say here that , ... i'm an infj , and i rarely play games , but when i do , i play sims 3 or a dance keep fit thing on my xbox kinect which always goes horribly wrong like 99 % of the time i'm an infj , and i'm still in school so my dream job would be a clinical psychologist . i ' not dreaming about the 6/7 years at university and how expensive that would be , though ! no problem :) annabee don't worry , i completely empathize with you ... the situation between myself and my isfj mother mirrors just that o you and your own relative ! just think that you have other people ( even on ... yes . he is fe dom , but he is really quite different from hazels mother , who is also fe dom but is an esfj . that is why i proposed he was an enfj :) i sort of found he used a lot of fe in his cognitive function stack - at the moment , i can't think of any particular examples , he just seemed to give off that fe vibe . what type do you believe he is ? ... ok , so i watched the film yesterday , which made me a complete emotional wreck , and i must say this : the types of all of the characters in the book were pretty much the same in the film , except for : ... true ... in some of her very first videos , she acts exceptionally quiet , sweet and shy , barely opening up at all and talking in a very quiet voice . i don't really like to say that this is introversion ... why do you think beth is an isfj ? i think she is a se dom rather than si ; i typed her as an esfp a while back on this thread . compare her with tanya burr , who is most certainly a classic isfj and you ... no problem . i find with those who are very new to the personality typing theory are much more ' vulnerable ' to it becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for some reason ! i find it intriguing that most people voted for infj . surely the term coldest emotionally could well refer to both outwardly and inwardly ? if both were the case , then the enfj would ... i've felt that i've become more self-aware at times , and how this relates to my type ( infj ) and if i do , say or think somethng , i just thik to myself oh , that was so infj or ni or whatever . maybe ... me - infj mother - isfj father - istj in all seriousness though , i have grown up with so much si in my extended family as well as my immediate that i often feel alien in my own home as it is a ... the fault in our stars ( from the book ) - i will watch the film and probably do a post here on the same thread perhaps about the characters being portrayed by type there too . hazel-infj gus - entp ... siena ( beautybysiena ) is an isfp first of allx 85what is your type ? infj on a scale of 1 to 10 ( 1 = low , 10 = high ) , how confident are you that you actually are the type you say you are ? 10 yes ! preach it ! ! basically , yes . he is just an entp with well - developed fe i can relate to you ! haha , we are even the same age and everything ! :) i completely agree with stonemoon , you must definitely learn about the cognitive functions as they are the key to knowing ... a few years ago , i never really cared about my appearance and even when i was 12 years old , i felt like people were judging me in real life because i was one of those shy , geeky girls who was kind to ... esfp's are apparently less talkative than infj's then ? ... esfp's are apparently more talkative than infj's then ? ... so true ! hello fellow infj :) i would be a blobfish ... i think :D hurray ! no problem :) nice username , by the way ! :D '
