it might be the avatars again . it's only because i'm actually bob dylan . i get horrendous sleep paralysis . it's less intense than it was even half a year ago , but i am still affected by it most mornings . i handle it far better now , though ( breathe , think about gravity , ... i'm an entp with a isfj mother and a esfp father . i have a creepy kind of obsession on an internet friend's brother . one day he'll love me . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTxj4aL1oNQ is it just me , or ... ?
