' i was was with my istj ex-husband for 14 years . we rarely argued . he was and still is very reliable , trustworthy , dependable and caring . we drifted apart because there was a lack of fun , ... 0 % - it says i should be vigilant about people with psychopathic traits who might take advantage . i guess when i was younger , i did assume the best and it was easy for certain individuals to ... i think that amongst xxfjs , particularly infjs and isfjs , there's an increased tendency to want to help and make others happy etc . i certainly feel that pull . we've just got to be careful that ... i'm scatty and often don't notice my surroundings because i'm in my own world . i put something down , like an umbrella , then walk off without it . i might be engrossed in something at work , eg a ... i have two daughters : one is esfj and one is enfj . their father ( my ex-husband ) is istj . so it's definitely possible for two introverts to produce extraverts ! i think if you are the one doing most of the ' giving ' in the relationship , and spending lots of time trying to make your so happy ( whilst not demanding the same in return ) you are more likely to be ... ok , but maybe it's just the way they answered the question in the survey . like rather than say how they really feel , they might say how they think they ought to feel based on logic . e . g . i must ... ah , c'mon now ! stop exaggerating ( even if it's for comic effect ) ! my best friend is a married female entp so i will consult with her and may get back to you to disprove your claim ! well i guess most people are cordial and polite to acquaintances because cordial and polite = distant . but sarcastic , teasing and tactlessly blunt ? that doesn't necessarily sound like ' being a ... what ? ? ? you mean if i start a relationship with an entp , he's going to have a few friends waiting in the wings , ready to take my place ? not sure i like the sound of that . better watch out for ... unemployment is stressful for anyone , but for a man ( of any type ) whose partner has a baby on the way and feels he ought to be the ' provider ' for his partner and baby ( as most men do ) then multiply ... purposive i know where you are coming from . i'm a very animated infj ( clearly not all of us are ) and i have an intj work colleague . when i'm talking to her it's like we're so similar yet so ... yes , i can see what you're saying here . with intps , i feel interested , engaged and amused . with entps , i feel the above plus energised , light , alive and completely myself . to generalise , ... mystery is istp . it's like somebody puts on the internet that he's infj and it suddenly becomes ' fact ' but if you look at his body language and eyes , they are nothing like an infj's . he is ... so , go on , what's the connection between infjs and ewoks , then ? i'm sure you'd love to tell us :) ok so here's another theory to throw into the mix : perhaps you are a more confident and secure person nowadays , so that you don't need to rely on external validation in order to feel good about ... my mum is an infp and my dad is an entj . they have been together for 43 years . they are really happy together and very close . they are rarely apart from each other , especially now that they are ... your advice is interesting . i like it . i was wondering if ti users like entps find it more difficult to work out what they want and therefore end up sometimes feeling bored , listless , disconnected ... probably they were infj cabbies ! you seem to be saying that an infj might accuse someone of a weakness as an excuse to withdraw from a relationship , when the real reason they are withdrawing is because the relationship makes them ... rationally , i am tolerant of other's weaknesses , but irrationally i can still get irritated . but if i'm feeling irritated , i tell myself ' well , they just can't help being like that . i work ... i'm starting to realise that i'm a little less structured and ' j ' than the average infj here . was brought up by infp mum so that might explain it ! well , finally there's something we can all agree an infj would not say ( i hope ) i'm just one of those people who doesn't dream - or at least if i do , i can't remember them when i wake up why ? don't tell me you like doing taxes ! probably i'm the atypical infj . i guess it just shows we're all different . ( to the boss ) just tell me what you want me to do and precisely how i should go about it . you don't need to worry my little head with the reasons behind or the purpose of the job . i had an interesting and fun morning going through my household budget , studying the monthly income and outgoings in great detail . i know that i am an infj because i know that my cognitive functions are ni-fe-ti-se in that order . but where have we got the idea that infjs perceive themselves as victims , enter into abusive ... what about things like health spas , massages from masseurs , pedicures etc ? a lot of women talk about how they love to be ' pampered ' but i'm really not into it . it's like : ' you're invading my ... i can relate to the situation the op describes and i have clashed with an estj at work a number of times . they're just so different to infjs and my habit of asking ' why ' is perceived as a criticism ... you say , i feel like i need to be impressive to be accepted . i think you summed up your whole post with this sentence . i have no idea what mb type you are , but the main thing you have to deal ... like diamonddays said , he sounds more ntj to me . some njs can test as nps ( myself included ) because we're more organised and decisive in a long term , driven kind of way and less interested in making ... what about following a pet theme like ' the dog ate it , the cat spat on it , the hamster used it as a blanket , the rabbit thought it was a carrot , a hedgehog hibernated in it ... ' something like that . ... my infp friend's 16 year old entp daughter says that she hasn't done her homework / course work because she's a ' kinaesthetic learner ' ! ? ? well that's what she tells her mum . i've no idea what she ... i keep asking these questions to all four of my entp friends . one of them has let it be known that my persistent questioning about what jobs she would like to do when her kids are older ( she's a ... this is great ! explains it so well . also , the part about integrating se in later life definitely applies to me . ( i'm 41 ) for me , fe seems like sharing emotions with others rather than delving too deeply in my own emotions . so when i see other people feel sad , it makes me feel sad . my everyday behaviour and my choice ... i express superficial emotions like excitement , irritation , frustration , happiness easily and frequently and i sometimes even exaggerate them for dramatic effect ! but when it comes down to the ... ^ a prime example of the dangers of ni overuse ! ! ok , i know you wrote it as a joke . but really , you've clearly spent a long time fantasising about this . is that a good use of your time ? or ... * thinks * hmm ... maybe it's not that people love to hate entps but that entps love to be hated ! you know - like how little kids play up and be naughty because being told off is still getting ... ooh diamonddays , i really hate you !
