' hah ! yes ! ! ! that would be fantastic . :D :D :D i suppose we'll have to agree to disagree . i think rather than inferior ne , that's actually unhealthy tertiary ni , ruminating about the future , and she gets caught in an unhealthy ti-ni loop . and ... did you mean red , mulan , and merida ? because i definitely agree on mulan ( istj ) & merida ( estp ) if that's the case . like 100 % agree , no question . :D red's harder for me . i'd thought possibly ... me , too ! : happy :: happy :: happy : ( and you're really good at explaining the reasons behind your typing , btw . :D i'm not always that great at it , even though i've really improved my understanding of ... oh , i think peeta is more than likely an xxfj - i was just glad that someone besides me at least considered isfp as a possibility . ( it's quite possibly the most misunderstood function combination , ... true ! that's a really good point . i love this movie , too ! and i apologize - i'm resurrecting a 3 Â½ year old thread , but i was going to start a new one , and then found this one . :) i want to add that i think it's important to ... i think this show is fantastic , and has really interesting characters . i usually have does anyone else watch it , and if so , what do you think of their types ? elizabeth mccord : i get an enxj ... robin hood : istp ( could see an argument for estp , but i don't think he's an extravert . i think his ti is dominant , and he's actually motivated by inferior fe , in a weird way . he's a pretty healthy ... that one's tricky ... freddie : i get an istp vibe , or * possibly * an estp vibe , but he's also incredibly emotionally damaged . so he's tough . i see explosions of inferior fe , though . and he has ... lol ! yup - it's pretty darn fi-heavy . ( and after more thought , i think maureen could be an esfp - i think her cause is actually more fi-driven than fe-driven . ) after reading your post , i had to get caught up on the new season - i've been a little behind on some of my favorites due to grad school , but finally got caught up . :) and if it makes you feel ... nice ! :D :D :D ( and you're welcome ! ) my best friend is pretty much in love with the hamilton soundtrack , though i still need to listen to it . ( it's on my list of things to do during the winter ... we finally have / had a villain ! ! ! :D :D :D * happydance * :D :D :D i mean ... um , cool . y'know , whatever . no big . ( * only an isfp would start giggling & inserting smileys about claiming a villain ... this . all of the above , just about . ( and can i just say how cool it is that you have roy typed as an isfp ? because many people type him as an xstp , but he's ... not . especially when you contrast him ... hmmm - that's a hard one . the only one where i have a strong vibe is seaweed , for xstp . probably estp , but i could see istp . the others are difficult , though i do get an exfp vibe from tracy . ... hah ! ! yes ... :D ( dominant ) ni vs te . ;) and i say that with love - i actually get along really well with intjs & entjs . usually , anyway ! ( i suspect it's because of the shared functions . ) ... i agree with just about all of this . ( seriously , like every bit of it except one thing . ) :) shawn : isfp cory : esfj topanga : enfj mr . feeny : intj ( * possibly * istj , but only as a very distant ... any thoughts on merlin's type ? i'm going to put a spoiler tag on this ( my thoughts , i mean ) , just in case people haven't seen the latest episode yet , where we learned a lot more about him . i ... guy - i definitely get an isfp vibe . :) faye - yeah , isfj would work , and would explain why she puts up with jimmy's jerkiness for so long . jimmy - i think honeychuckles is right about infj , ... also , my istp best friend thinks barry is an isfp , in this iteration . and honestly , it does work . his fi is pretty darn clear , in my opinion . i do think he can seem ne when he gets excited about ... yes ! ! very much so . and the whole , very direct , yeah - i don't care attitude whenever anyone brought up anything earth 1 harrison wells / eobard thawne did . basically : i'm not him . get over it .. i'm glad i'm not the only one who thought peeta could be an isfp . :) i'm not certain , but i think it's at least a possibility . ( though katniss is a poster child for istp , haha . ) i've often seen ... i agree with all of this , save perhaps amy . :D ( and i need to re-watch - i had her as an estp , because i saw a lot of se in her , but could understand other possibilities . ) :D :D :D i agree with almost all of yours . :D ( and i can see arguments for the others . ) :D you might repost it on the longer once thread : http://personalitycafe.com/guess-type/76372-once-upon-time.html ... sorry , just have to say - no ... no , he's not . rdj's holmes might be entp , but classic literature holmes certainly is not . he's a textbook example of an intj . various characterizations might seem ... i think kuzco is esfp , because it's all about se-fi ( very selfish fi ) . isfj makes sense for patcha . :D and i'm not sure on his wife - i could see several things for her . ( but she's awesome , ... oh my goodness yes ! :D :D :D i was re-watching that episode the other day , and it was brilliant . and perfect , especially the cordelia aspect . ( though oz's is hilarious as well - so very ti-ne . ) he is careful , but i attribute that to maturity & se not being dominant . ( he certainly wasn't careful as a young lad , haha . ) he also prefers to take direct , immediate action , & i see inferior te in ... lol ! ;) ( could be ... it's strikingly similar to arguments i've had with ixtps . ) but what's funny to me is that your post is pretty classic aux fe . :D oh , believe me , i agree that his behavior ... i'm not disagreeing that sometimes people describe fi as archetypal . all i was saying was that people often describe si as archetypal , including someone who created the entire system based on jung's ... examples of fi , se , and inferior te , per your request . : happy : okay ... i'm going to defend myself against some of your arguments , because again - i think it's important that people don't realize that just because someone writes a lot or says something doesn't ... i think she's rather an awesome poster child for infps . : happy : what do you think the other characters are , ocarinafan 96 ? just because you would characterize si that way doesn't mean that's the way it's actually defined . any introvert could do this , particularly in periods of depression . particularly when combined ... 284274 here's my buffy type table . :) ( finding someone who was even potentially a decent example of an enfj was tough . on angel , lorne is obvious , but i was trying to stick to just the ... a ) that's not an indication of si ( more fi , living in harmony with his own internal moral code ) . b ) he actually doesn't . there are periods of time where he does live in the sewers , but you're ... actually ... his decision to try to do good dates back to when his soul was restored . he was no longer able to kill humans , because he believed it was wrong . he even saves a puppy ( much to angelus's ... okay , re-watching buffy , and have pondered a bit more ... i go back & forth sometimes on a few characters , but i'm more certain of their functions now . ( not as certain of their enneagram types . ) ... this is absolutely spot-on , for all of the reasons you said . : happy : ( i have not read the book , so this is just looking at the musical . ) i think that elphaba is often mistyped as an infj , and i ... peggy is a pretty amazing and well-balanced te-dom ( definitely no fe ) , and seems much more ni / se than si / ne . she's not afraid of being blunt and speaking her mind , and is comfortable taking charge ... i agree with all of this . :D :D :D and i love sousa - he's my favorite character on the show . i think he's definitely ixfp , and i lean towards isfp . ( not just because i want him to be my type . ) ... thank you ! ! :D :D :D ( and i know a number of infps , and you guys do have a feisty side ... i'll have to try to subtly add that in . ) :D oh , very much so . i can get very excited when talking about favorite topics , or if i'm very overwhelmed with emotion ( positive or negative ) or stress , but even then , i'm usually on a pretty even ... awww , absolutely ! :D well , i have friends / family of every type ( confirmed ) , and tried to get as much input as possible before doing each type's square , and as i went along . i asked people if ... thank you all for your feedback ! :) ooh ! that's actually a fantastic idea - i like that a lot ! i'm planning on tweaking the design ( s ) in the future , and when i do , i may change it to that , ... lol ! ! :D :D :D ( one of my best friends is an istp , so ... i get it . ) : wink : : laughing : hahaha ! ! :D :D :D i thought all of your thoughts & suggestions were really helpful ! :) ( and i have an intp father & several intp friends , so i was prepared for a good critique ... those are great ideas . :D :D :D oh , absolutely ! ! ! : happy : :D :D :D and thank you so much ! here's a link to the files on dropbox - the type table & all the type squares , too . :D ... thank you ! ! :D :D :D and oooh ! haha - those are great ideas - i may have to try to incorporate them in . ;) ( at least the top hat - i love that . ) '
