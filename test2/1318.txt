close friends and ... an awkward end to awkward silence probably isn't the best . i find that actually doing something with another person helps . conversation generally comes up naturally then . lazy but apt . typical intp indeed . i like when a problem is actually solvable , but in relation to the rubik's cube , i don't like when it's just a matter of memorizing something or just using a trick . i don't like what it's so easy ... vocaroo | voice message i forgot to mention that i would share , but i don't have them with me . i found this picture to be pretty hilarious . i feel that it's likely very apt as well . i don't actually know any intj's personally but i can imagine this is what an intp and intj would look like . ... vocaroo | voice message don't burn me at the stake , but i

up and start . er , perhaps you could introduce yourself ... don't forget that you started it at 3:00 pm but somehow didn't actually get anything done until around 3:50 pm . vocaroo | voice message i may or may not have tried this multiple times because i kept messing up or i just didn't like it in general . perhaps i'm a bit of a perfectionist . eh , either way there it ... i don't really know how to define a best friend . there's a friend i've had for about nine years . he's the kind of friend that i can just talk to about whatever i feel like talking about . with ... yeah i know what you mean . there's just so many great attributes to me , i couldn't possibly choose one or two out of all of them . : wink : i shouldn't have slept for two extra hours this morning . i know that i get headaches when i oversleep , but i still do it anyway . in my experience there are many intp's that are like that . i'm personally a music person , but i do enjoy art and i also mess around with poems and what not when i'm out and about and bored . i've had an on / off relationship , possibly obsession , with the word inexorable , for the past few months . my at least weekly use of it is , well , inexorable . so , intp's aren't necessarily emotionless , just don't tell anybody because we will all deny it . seriously , every single one of us . you sound kind of stressed out right now and a bit ... i'm not sure how much of a confession this counts as . i was just watching a movie , submarine , and it's pretty funny during the first half . so i was laughing quite hard during this one scene and i'm ... while there are varying time factors for all of us , this is entirely true and kind of sad . all it takes is a negative emotional plateau and ok resolve , and the feelings could be gone , possibly ... i cry due to external circumstances , likely because of fe . it can happen in the form of media such as books / anime / movies , or because of real people and experiencing their feelings / situation with ... i like spring or autumn . i prefer temperatures around 65-70 . rainy days are usually best . winter would be my next choice though . my hand eye coordination is usually bad , unless i'm really focused and using my s ( i have moderately high s , but my n isn't quite as high as i'd prefer . ) i'm also good at reflexively catching things , ... i didn't even need to read your user description to know you sir , are an intp . people ask me what i want to eat , or what i want to do later , or insert question here . generally i just answer with i don't know . i wouldn't really mind getting a pm . if anything the interaction is always a plus , i haven't really talked with another nt before . i'm also a pretty indifferent person , and don't forget we're intp's , ... there isn't really a whole lot of information to go on with your particular situation . it's possible she didn't expect you to confess so soon and isn't actually ready to go anywhere . perhaps you ... i guess intp's under the influence of emotion addiction do similar things . you could blab your feelings to me if you want , maybe we could support each other . one addict to another . : wink : uh ... i heard that the teen years is when fe really starts to develop , or at least tries to . for me , the past few years have been me reading / watching something just for the emotional aspect ... there's this kid at my school who thinks i don't like hand sanitizer , and i have no clue why . so he'll put it on my desk ( usually he only tries to ) , not in the bottle but just the semi-solid . then ... actually play it . how to make a game without it existing ? i've always been unmanly as most of us intp's probably have . i don't think there are many of us that are into sports , and i doubt there

don't still exist somewhere , lost and lonely . i like snakes , though i wouldn't mind a cat either . then there's armadillo lizards ... honestly i don't think i have one . i'm more indifferent and treat most days the same . holidays / birthdays i forget about . sometimes i wonder if it would be better being an infp . love : 1 . books 2 . knowledge 3 . music 4 . interesting stuff 5 . rainy days are nice hate : 1 . the 15 post or greater limit for private messages / conversations 2 . obnoxious people of course bump . 38 pages is not enough , please feed my fe . it's cute and you like it right
