' here's what i personally feel . everything can be explained through ' science ' . there isn't such thing as ' magic ' . the term , ' magic ' is used is because no one out there went to do an in-depth research ... sorry to disappoint you however , i am a male just like what my profile stated . i heard that only 5 % amongst the intj are females . singapore , born singaporean chinese . yes i did .. once .. an year ago . didn't go so well and i still haven't gotten over it . i am working with an intj artist ... intj comes in all shape and sizes .. you could imagine one of the donuts you bought from the donut store happens to be an intj too . ok ... on the serious note to support your research . i am 1.81 m , ... bold claim . what evidence do you wish to present to support this claim ? i know because i ask myself this question . would an intj bother to post such a thing in tumbler with just 1 sentence point form and random gif ? the possibility is quite low on this one ... what if i tell you , the person posting that isn't an intj as well . it depends on gender and level of intimacy . i would mostly say no to most ( if not all ) male to male hug . i wish for a hug from a person whom i like ... # 8 , and probably the main reason why a lot of people hate me . # 9 , i tend to do that .. it's not very healthy though . #10 & #12 , indeedth . i do hope you and him get together since you really like him . intjs like to ' logicfy ' things also , plan stuff . they are really independent too so when he says give him time , he mean it . all the best . the subtle art of not giving a fuck tbh , i have inferior complexity . that pretty much sums it up for my case . well .. my very own studios consist of 3 intjs including me . none of us fall under the category of christianity . this one is close enough : ... the world , the galaxy , the universe yes they are . most girls don't fall under the tj spectrum in the first place . my psychology lecturer once told me that the 16 type is only fixed when the person past 21 or ' become mature ' . the ... my aunt passed away all of the sudden and i didn't get a chance to see her last moment . that made me cry . personal experience here . i like this girl and i muster up my guts and start having conversation with her because that is the part i start giving a damn . i am an intj guy btw . if your friend is the ... we want things to be logically right and we mean it . yes .. i am quite proud of myself when someone test my intellect . why suicide when you can chose to kill others ? just one word for them . uh .. okwhat problem ? the government had some subsidy on it . other than that , it's freaking expensive . i learned quite a lot there being tortured mentality . it's well spent since it's what i wanted . , but what if and why not both ? thanks for the compliment on the avatar . quite true that he is leaning towards the j with his ocd habit and every single thing must have an order in his life . but what happen if an intp has ocd or you believe that the group of intp will ... my iq is 137 if i remember . i don't really think it will conclude that i am smart . then again , i graduated from digipen institute of technology with the bachelor of computer science and game design ... for someone who doesn't read you sure made us read . then again , i don't read much and i happens to be a writer in gamereplays.org . there's a chart that says sheldon cooper is intp . i was snubbed in my 2 years of military service . probably because i am too blunt and clumsy . i don't like to see those bunch of people again . immortality holds the curse of seeing your friend dies and yet you live on . lemme give you an example of what i meant . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR2JzK-y5_g you are not an intj if you hate to argue . intj seldom flirts around . questions overloaded . i shall reply them anyway . do you daydream ? yes do you feel as if your emotions are dulled , or do not work right ? yes do you seek attention , or show off ? yes for ... i guess i am being lonely nowadays .. op , just find someone who's straight forward . people who are and aren't don't go well together . i been through that shit , i know . it's tough but trust me on this . as introverts , we wish to be alone but yet yearn to be with somebody special . who is with me on this . none off topic , here i come ! i m for cloning of human . but there will be issues of dictators abusing it to clone more of themselves . i am a programmer . i strategically plan how i code . see an orthopedic doctor ? chinese orthopedic doctor even better . nah , you are just introverted . why did you make it sounds like us intjs are pro-cheater in the title ? if you think he's cheating , why do you even care about him so much ? you are so early in your ' relationship ' with him , either you ... adult stuffs are boring in general . i always do things that kids do for the fun of it . though end of the day , i remember that i am an adult . i dreamed about the girl i like for the 3rd time . what's that all about ? if he is an intj , he likes you . sounds kinda intj to do whatever necessary to show affection . http://i60.tinypic.com/fvzp1u.jpg well .. i am just lazy to clean that up ... if that makes you happy , i know an entj who happens to be a programming genius . more on the genetic aspect , less on the taboo , i concern . cross breeding is a course of evolution in trading superior gene , hence making humans stronger .
