! ! : fall : the nameless composer , i am an esfj who married outside my ethnicity , religion and nationality . forget tradition .. i have fe . the heart wants what the heart wants . i think those pairings are ideal for ease of communication and daily living . this of course which can lead to long term relationship success if that is what someone is seeking , but everyone has ... t men with fe . i have dated fi men ( entj and intj ) and we clash romantically . jcal , that is a very interesting observation . not to deviate from the topic of this thread but i personally start feeling depressed if i am not in a role where i can care for others in some capacity ... i'm a female esfj and have only known two other male esfjs in a marriage . both of them married very introverted women . my one male esfj friend from childhood was always looking to date someone he ... despite being very high on the e side of esfj i am more and more hobbit like with each passing year . i certainly enjoy the comforts of my home and having friends visit and stay over . introspection ... are you certain he is an esfj ? sounds much more like an estj to me . esfjs are not afraid to express intense feelings . as an fe dom we live for that sort of thing !
