ha , you got jokes . umm , i think we think differently than intj's , but intelligence is not type related . any type can be really smart . they will tell you most intps ( i only know one intp , myself ) dont like to lie or keep secrets . listen carefully , and they will spill the beans . so cutie , why havent you called me ? : tongue : not all feminist believe the same thing . some believe in a woman's right to self determination . so if she wants to be a housewife , or a stripper , it doesn't matter . what matters is the person's ... ok ... look down on me : happy : if your looking down on me , how do you expect me to provide you your jacket . i hear it gets cold up there . entj's are warm and fuzzy on the inside . you just have to be their special circle of important people , then the flood of affection begins . ahhh , the intp mind game continues ... that's what george clooney said about doing it a second time . most people end up married at some point . im awesome in bed . thats where i do my best work ... sleeping , daydreaming , and net surfing . when i really get adventurous , i eat in bed ! ! ! yep , its an awesome place . not all womem aee the same . some are ok with prenups . men seem to think of women in stereotypes . women think of women in stereotypes . the fact is , each person is an individual . flirting online is awesome . in real life , i just admire from a distance . so sad . : frustrating : get ready , because i've been known to blow some minds . i can shatter a mind to pieces . its putting it back together ... that i don't do . i fancy entj's . : tongue : and how many status quo do i have to break ... because i'm ready to smash them all ! ! i can understand that . people seem to think only men feel traped . i guess i'm mostly indifferent to marriage . the commitment to me is just as real , whether married or not . so , you need someone to share your jacket ? hey , you ever had a fantasy about being with an intp . i know your people may not approve of my wild style , but i could make your fantasies come true ... hey entj's it gets lonely at the top . you won't be so lonely with me by your side as you looking down at your empire . : happy : yeah , entp's have a way of sneaking in . i used to think you live your life right and prince charming will see you in the shopping isle and walk up saying your the one for me ... there is no other . nope ... only happens when lightning ... oh , no , you do bite . but some people can take the pain , others bite back . but , if you can handle the bite , and you get close enough , then you can cut an entj open . then you get to taste all the ... your secret is safe with me ... except for you , me , and the hundreds who read this thread , no one will know inside you're warm and fuzzy . : wink : yep , cuz i cut one open before . all i found was warm and fuzzy . : happy : are entj's warm anx fuzzy on the inside ? yep ! ! but you gotta cut them open to find out . are you willing to get that close ? intj's most intimidating because of death stare . entj's second most imtimidating because of sheer force , and determination . ok , do you expect to never die . so do everything you ever dreamed of big , medium , small , and do it . you don't want to say i wish i had ... so you want a soulmate ... go find one , there exists ... yeah , marriage is horrible . despite popular belief , i think it hurts the woman more than the man . women ask for it , but take on more responsibility . you cant sex a guy as often as ... so entj's do you wear a suit ... like a boss do you stand ... like a boss do you command people ... like a boss cuz if you do ... that's hot . call me : tongue : i like people who do ... the worst that could happen is you end up liking it and having to support a new habit . happens to people who drink and smoke cigarettes too . but cigarettes will kill you . most hoarders can't be helped by cleaning . the problem isnt the inability to clean , but a brain dysfunction . something in their brain doesn't register the problem , so you can't fix what you ... i used to think pot was sooo bad , because it was illegal . now i've grown up . hey entj's are you as cruel , angry , evil , self serving , soul less , dark and brutal as people say you are ? cuz if you are ... that's hot . : tongue : cuz entp's be trolling hard elsewhere . what's worse than weed and will kill you ... cigarettes . legal in all states . so what do you want the government to do . say yes and no . where should resources go . there is more of a threat to health from cigarettes , yet the goverment says yes . next to smoking is ... i am dominant only when someone steps on my principles . i believe in equality and self determination . so when i believe it is threatened for myself or someone else , i sink my teeth in and fight ... i highlighted what you just said . thank you for admitting that criminalizing personal behavior is wrong . so if you don't criminalize it , what do you do ? don't take rejection personally . everyone gets rejected , everyone at some point or place in life . the saying goes ... the way a person treats another says more about themselves than the other ... is there a right way to drink ? alcohol is everywhere . there was a time that was illegal too . people soon realized you cant criminalize human behavior . substance of choice shouldn't matter . ... i would explain it to you my friend , but , your very unlikely to meet one until you leave that all boy's school . i suggest you leave at midnight , when everyone else is asleep . i agree with you that natural is a fallacy . i have some natural weight loss pills that poop my pants . i aint taking that sh * t no more . i'm saying if cigs was just the tobacco it would be almost harmless . most people know old persons who smoke cigars or pure tobacco and live to 100 . if i had a choice between cigs and weed , i would ... weed should be legal . i dont see people in europe and canada going crazy because they have legal weed . as far as i know , weed isnt causing these countries to increase incarceration for weed ... i think cigs are poision , weed is a natural herb . legalize it . yeah , haiti knows about zombies . lol . thats a high price to pay for an unjust law . laws that are wrong need to be changed . i don't want someone in jail for vicodin , so why jail for weed . the law is wrong . yeah in the south you get a free room ... actually tax paid room in prision people go in prision , come out with record , no treatmennt , just a record . how does that help the person , or society ? why is marijuana criminalized . why isnt vicodin , or other prescription pills . why arent vicodin users jailed , but marijuana users imprisioned . i believe drug abuse is not criminal behavior . ... intps wont survive the zombie apocalypse unless they remain in the basement until its all over . theories and deep thought will mean nothing when zombies are after your brain . people who are non violent should be allowed to cross the border into the us and stay all drugs should be legal , drug abuse is not a criminal offense children at 16 can become adults at that age ... ok , lets all just hold hands and sing an i just got banned song . start an i got banned from thread ... and post your sorrows there while you drink your anger away .
