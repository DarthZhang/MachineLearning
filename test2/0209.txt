enfps are my ever present fascination , although i quite like most nfs . i also like intjs usually and i have several esfps that are quite close . i must admit , i still don't know how to take your nosebleed photo : confused : something i see a lot of people doing is they make a generic resume about themselves and just spam it out there to employers . and you may already be doing this , but if you take time to tailor your ... sure you get a degree to get a job , but employers are looking for your ability to think , because they'll train you to do what they want , not your school . and i am debt free thank you very much ! ... i think there are a lot of myths about education that should be disregarded . the biggest is that you're training for a job . a bachelor's degree is about training to think . certainly , there are some ... 94641 i'm a male , but if i were to venture a guess about your situation , i would guess that she wants emotional validation rather than wanting you to really change yourself . it's just hard for ts and fs to ... salt lake city , utah :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EOi91-Ge6c http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUaCxx5npko oh the mustache love at 5:10 is glorious ! and mogwai rocks ! ... sjs just kinda make the world go round . i mean , i love me some ns and all their ideas and whatnot , but someone has gotta make it happen and we're here to do that :) and specific to isfjs , we sure ... i'm the third of four . but got a pretty big age gap between me and the two oldest . over time i've decided that appearance is huge . i'm always sitting back and looking at the details of how people present themselves , so i decided i better present myself in a way that i'm okay with ... i think my introversion kinda takes me into my own world frequently ... well , the si . in those times , i just don't really put anything on my face . i'm sure i look like a real goober . get told i ... sense of humor 70 % sense of fashion 69 % relationship intentions 98 % intellectual pursuits 58 % physical appearance 67 % financial situation 45 % hobbies and interests 83 % i think that the inferior ne helps too . apparently that gives the isfj a kinda quirky sense of humor . like we pick up on things , but really don't trust it , so we play it off as sarcasm and act all ... hahahahahaha ... i'm glad you have a sense of humor about it . really though , it does sound that absurd , but there is a lighter side to life i think you need to embrace . there is a lot of upside to ... enfpanorama - i honestly didn't read your whole post , but i can tell you what the problem is . isfjs and enfps both love people . they're kind and caring and both have a way of getting people to open ... dude ! you need to stop hating on yourself . bottomline ! stop it ! i guarantee you are imagining people think worse of you than they really do . so they get a little overloaded with you now and ... amen to that ! lots of talking it out to find some reason to it ( which ends up being a reason that probably makes no sense to anyone else ) . honestly , i carry the feelings with me in some buried part ... welcome ... and i'd be willing to bet you're an enfj ... enfp may sound right sometimes , but what nf doesn't feel like they can connect to anything , right ? anyhow , welcome and hope you find a niche . i think you really nailed a reason why we have the potential to be really out going . the si and the fe is really an advantage to me . i actually know several esfps and they love attention , but they ... i really enjoy darkness . i think people all too often overlook many of the harsh realities they themselves face or others are facing and i love an artistic portrayal of that . there is certainly ... i've got a really good friend that is an intj . we have some pretty good times and laugh like crazy when we get talking . in serious times , we both process things in such different ways , that i feel ... i'm a fan of irony ! and there's nothing like a good story teller . love a good story with humor mixed in there http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qp1b1Lq0Vs couple interesting things here . 1 ) totally feel ya on the feeling older thing , as a kid . i think that comes from the sj sense of propriety ( which was pointed out ) 2 ) the being able to be childish ... @ isfjfan , kinda a crappy situation for you , my friend . the more i experience , the more i realize a lot of people don't have the introspective skills they need to move on from the things that went ... ( in reference to the enfp one ... ) you're right , the problem with the enfp one is that none of those spectacular projects would ever get completed without another type being there . infjs pretty much don't exist . so you're probably an isfj . i have the same issue . i often come up as infj , but you have to understand that the introverted sensing function comes across as ... beautiful and simple ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLrSbO2ene8 i'm glad a couple infjs chimed in . obviously that was expected , because i kinda put this out there in a somewhat abrasive fashion . fortunately , you guys sound like you're into using personality ... you mean the way i would , given just little time with someone ? don't get me wrong , infjs exist , but they are rare and a lot of isfjs get it wrong . that's likely true . in fact i know it's true , because there are tons of infps here and not a whole lot of isfjs , but i meet far too many purported infjs in everyday interaction to believe it . i ... leave it to an enfp to love all over an infj hahaha i probably am slightly jealous , but fortunate for me , there are pretty much no infjs to be jealous of ;) honestly the thing with isfjs is their ... this may be a bit of a rant , but i'm convinced a lot of people that test as , and think they are infjs are not actually said personality type . let's just talk sheer numbers . 1 % . infjs represent 1 % ... i would say you just gotta try something new a few times and the isfj will get really good at it . we're not the type to suggest new things easily , but i know i'm always game for trying something new ... omg ! ! ! i've taken up barefoot running too ! although , i'm kinda new to it , but i really like it ! lullaby ! awesome ! this is my favorite kind of relationship to cheer on , because it seems so hard , but like there can be so many good things : happy : such good things to bring up ! i particularly relate to needing to say no , talking about my accomplishments and using writing to let out my feelings . crimsonice , that's hilarious ! though i'm not sure that would cut it for an isfj for long . we'd start to feel resented and then return the resentment we perceive exists ( at least i can see myself ... or she's an experienced isfj that's learned through time that it's okay to be a little more like an infp and tell the world to go f * * * itself . i'm fairly certain that a lot of isfjs care so much ... life is easier with an introvert . no worrying about keeping them entertained and no having to hear their gripes about being bored ... well ... at least not nearly so much . on the other hand , ... run screaming ! ! ! if an enfp loses interest , it's over . it may not seem like it's over , because they'll come back and be affectionate on you like they are with everyone else and it will be ... i have to be honest , i can't handle any significant amount of time around estx ... just doesn't work for me at all . everything they think just seems so natural and logical to them and they can't ... hahahaha i love it ! ! ! hugs are great when you just have that great vibe of affection for and from a person . i love that lilsnowy ( an enfp ) posed the question too , such an affectionate type and a ... i'm gonna have to say it depends on the intent ... but in general i'm a big fan of a good hug : wink : i'm glad things are going well :D that really warms my heart . i know the op probably isn't paying attention anymore to this thread , but i find this case so interesting . i also think that i can relate . i dated a girl a while back that was everything i could've ... that was tremendously un-insightful . sounds a lot like an extrovert trying to imagine introversion as an extrovert . didn't quite make it to that empathetic chord , did ya ? that's not how it works . ... i'm fine with the some stereotypes of gays being characteristics i possess . i like to be dressed well and match . i don't get dirty . i moisturize . i like to smell good . i may even move a little ... i can't help but laugh hahaha ... my infp friend says isfjs are like ostriches that think they're hiding by sticking their heads in the sand . everybody just kinda lets us be quietly weird , but every ...
