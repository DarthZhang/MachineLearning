fit any of the types . it was so weird . then we found out he is ... i agree ... and i think a lot of people who believe they are nfs but are actually sps have embraced this , because so many of the

of 2 girls . one is isxp , like me , and the other one is an enfj . my husband passed away a few months ... but you might actually be on to something : when people point out my imperfections , or what
