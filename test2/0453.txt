' dogs are so cute and so are enfps :) oooh this is fantastic advice :) thank you :) thank you :) i agree :) aw why do you think that :( it can still work ! one time i had a plant that died and looked really dead and everyone said throw it out and then i watered it and put it in the sun because why not i ... whoa weird , he said both of those things , minus the dedication part . i have yet to see that part :( lots of making out and a sad goodbye because i moved :( hehehehehehehe :) you're good also what ended up happening on your end ? why arent you and the enfp together anymore ? you honestly have a gift with words . you could not have described it better . losing an enfp is absolute devastation because you lose tht person that makes you not feel like a misunderstood unicorn ... thank you :) i couldn't agree more . my best friend is enfp and i always tell her that she is truly better than any friend i could have ever dreamed up . we have so much chemistry that i am not sure if ... if it were that simple , i would not have posted this in the first place . you're so right . he did even say i have never gotten attached to someone this quickly before as a bad thing . i am sorry you were manipulated :( people who do that need to get a life . hey , thanks for your response :) why did you guys break up ? did you ever consider or try to get her back ? i'm sorry about that :/ yup , he mentioned that haha . but isn't it a great method ? at least i can rule out booty call . thank you :) you are spot on . everything you said was right on the money , truly . thank you for just getting it . i may be future tripping , but i am worried that one day something will just click ... i never did that with him , i wouldn't even consider it unless i was in a long term , committed relationship thank you so much , everything you said was incredibly on point ... where his heart knows but for any number of reasons he doesn't feel worthy enough of what his heart wants . he actually said this ... i guess i just wish i knew what he wanted , and that if he doesnt know , to leave me alone . him taking actions that make me think he might care really won't let me move on to someone else , no matter ... well i think this is absolutely true . i think he fell in love with me , and he realized it when he went away and missed me , and so he ended it because of how serious it became . and he has exactly ... hi you :) thank you for your amazing advice again and for remembering . i think that time has already passed already :/ he made his decision back in the fall ( on impulse , unfortunately ) and he has to ... i know right :) ^ sooo true , all of it ! very well put . i door slammed because he was being an ass btw :/ it is immature , i only did it out of respect for myself , to not expose myself to that treatment again . i do ... nooo , probably just mental cheating , no ? i can't see an enfp cheating unless their f is underdeveloped so true . when did that thinking end for you , if ever ? no no that's not what they meant , enfps are super loyal . my best friend is one and she is the most loyal and incredible friend , i couldn't dream anyone better than her . but enfps definitely get ... thank you for responding :) i asked him if we could still be friends back in the fall when we broke up , and he said that he couldn't be , we couldn't be . i think he is right ... it is difficult to ... thank you , this made a lot of sense and clarified a lot . he is so emotionally intelligent and people intelligent that it was odd behavior and so it makes sense that he wouldn't make the connection ... hey , thanks for your response :) i totally agree , he does not want to get tied down to me which is why it ended :( but i don't think he is trying to find someone better . he knows i was good for him , ... why does my enfp ex call to x93check in , x94 text , longingly make x93hintsx94 here and there that i am special to him , contacting me for every holiday , that his mom remembers me , etc . last summer he said he ... yes i do wish i could do this ! one semester i had to take in completes for two classes because i couldn't focus , my emotions were clouding everything . it only happened once , usually i have them under ... once upon a time a young woman was at a social gathering , drawing people to her by listening deeply to them . across the room she noticed another doing the same thing , just in a different way . he was ... :) 405706 the worse that could happen by waiting is that he goes away , for good , no ? entps and reading into every little thing ! yes he's entp . i guess i meant biting in that when someone can take ... once upon a time a young woman was at a social gathering , drawing people to her by listening deeply to them . across the room she noticed another doing the same thing , just in a different way . he was ... awesome , thank you ! you have clarified his thinking process , and i absolutely will do as you suggest . you made me realize i had forgotten to mention that he had indeed suggested that he doesn't want ... when he told me he was enfp two weeks ago , i ran for the hills , and for good reason . the one enfp male i had dealt with wasn't reliable ... all over the place , overwhelmed easily , a nightmare . when he ... yes ! ! exactly thanks pinkachu . i can identify with your experience . trauma like that forces you to think in fight or flight responses which can affect the people we love . i did tell him about a week after i ... thank you for making me laugh unexpectedly : sexual assaults are a gift that just keeps on fucking giving . as for you are not ultimately responsible for the ways your own assault will affect ... hi , thank you for you response . i am so happy he / she was prosecuted . i ended up sending him a pdf letter over email explaining everything ( will help from bethdeth ) and he had a kind response but he ... i agree , but then why are intjs attracted to extroversion ?
