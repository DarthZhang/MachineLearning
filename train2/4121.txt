i guess ollivander is an istj . based on the first post you're definitely an ixtj . probably intj . i think he's more like an isfj , for example how he says there's no reason for him to distrust snape since dumbledore trusts snape . i don't think i'm necessarily repulsed by fe , but i think it is usually better to use te . i want to be sure of my mbti , and it has recently become a bit more difficult . does anyone know what an isfj who uses more ti than fe really looks like , compared to an istj ? you seem more p than j but i'm not able to be completely sure based on this . try filling out a questionnaire . it helps . why not try checking which function you're most definitely not dominant with , and then look at the opposite of that function ? actually , it's looking like the majority is wrong while i'm right on this . i definitely see se above si in your answer to question 9 . not all isfps are the same . some are forceful , others are laid ... strange that no one has said isfp in this thread yet . that's what i think you are . i'm not sure i can see snape being inferior with te yet . he is stronger with te than with fi . he is relying on external rules and laws . anyone who just watches the films and doesn't read the books won't know that sirius and lupin used to be in the shrieking shack . while it's shown that they treated snape badly , snape still could have ... that was not in the film . i think you could be an istj . what do you think about this type ? do its functions fit you ? if you really want to know which type you are , study and learn the functions . severus snape in the harry potter films is an intj . because he's suspecting quirrell to be on the bad side based on nothing except for his ni . he's also the only teacher to come to the shrieking ... i agree with you about all this , except for about snape . what made you say infp above istj for him ? in general , this isn't indicative of him using fi-ne above si-fe . where do you see his fi ? that part about him being good at reading his students would be fe . lupin has also had many experiences of the map never lying . the rest is behaviour an isfj could also have . another thing : the ... i'm pretty sure he has to be either an isfj or an infj . these two types can be difficult to tell apart . my view of lupin , however , is that he's dominant with si rather than with ni . he could really ... snape had more friends other than lily while at school . does anyone here think snape could be dominant with te , and be either an estj or an entj ? it was a random thought that crossed my mind , and i'm a bit surprised about the fact that absolutely nobody ... i would disagree with a few of the op typings . both hermione and snape appear to be sjs , i'm having hermione as an estj and snape as an istj . i got isfj or infj . i'm not sure if i see ni or si as the dominant function , but that fe focus on others is there . i think you're introverted because of your answer to question 9b . based on this , she's definitely an introvert , but that's all i can be sure of . try filling out a stickied questionnaire and see what people get from that . i get enxp from that . you can actually be an istp and use more ni than se . consider istp as well . snape actually has fi over fe . if i saw some intuition in snape , such as him considering harry might have to die before dumbledore told him ... then i would say he is an intj . but now i don't see ... i'm dominant with si , and i don't either think you should think too much about sad memories . it's better to think about happy memories . true , but based on his behaviour istj is still my best guess . but don't sjs think about the past more than others ? si compares what the senses currently say to what they have said before . you need ... that's it , i see tertiary fi now . i now think snape actually is an istj . it is bad that more than half of everyone who voted thinks snape is an intj . intjs think more about the future than the past . snape does the opposite of that . he can be an istj , but he can't be an ... i see tefi here , not feti . you say that you're ruled by your strong emotions in stressful situations , which would be tertiary fi rather than auxiliary fe . so my guess is that you are an intj . an intp can also be sentimental about one of the people he cares most about , that's not necessarily fi by definition . there was a scene where i think snape's behaviour fitted carl jung's ... he didn't only do that , he gave harry other things as well , in a short period of time . snape can be really good at adapting , such as when he dies . esfp seems possible . has nobody got anything to say ? actually , i have changed my opinion from intp to istj . i'm 18 years old and am currently attending a school which i began at at the age of 16 and will quit at the age of 20 . it is currently the summer holidays . in mbti , i mostly relate to si , then te ... by reading this i am reminded about the descriptions for ti , and i don't think your ti is weaker than your fe at all . i'm going to guess intp for you . for example , your answers to questions 10 and 12 . i agree with a lot , if not all , of this . please people , keep discussing snape's mbti ! he's a well-written character ! thanks in advance ! :) an esfp is better with se than fi , an isfp is better with fi than se . an esfp is better with te than ni , an isfp is better with ni than te . esfps focus more on the outer world , isfps focus more on ... you might be an xsfp . if you want to know your type for sure though , learn the functions . i'll help you doing that a bit , if you want to . whatever you are , you're not dominant with fe , so that means not enfj . where do you see ni and te in snape ? i think hagrid was more of an e than an i . esfp . luna was a ti-user . intp . fred and george were using a lot of ne . enxps . i'd say ixfp seems like a good fit for you . going on the information provided in this thread , you appear to be introverted and an fi-user .
