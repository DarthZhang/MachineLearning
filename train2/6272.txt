' i feel like i rolled in glass , just so bad , so much pain . i am tired of feeling bad . i am tired of pain . i feel inadequate and discouraged and so very scared - all the time ... when will things get ... i couldn't say it better . the sad thing is , now that i'm a mom , my kids pay for my mistakes , too . i am not doing very well at all right now , perc friends . please send good thoughts or prayers my ... i am so happy for you both whatever helps your confidence is ok by this infj ! i avoid eye contact when i feel vulneralbe because i don't want to know what the person is thinking . don't lie to us because we know and we get insulted on so many levels ... i had someone tell me they were going to help their son practice kicking , this information can be easily verified . i know ... all the above plus him referring it to the hunka chunka . whew , laughed ' til my side hurt ! ok , now i'm wishing you lived near ohio , lol you definately don't sound infj to me . we make peace not war and the first paragraph is inaccurate and insulting all at the same time . now for my inner peace , which i value above all else , i am ... ista , you are irritating some infj's that i have never heard get mad . i'm thinking you are the problem , not your infj . maybe it's time you went back to intp's . we don't stir up easy and you are ... i apologize for my ignorance ... technology isn't my thing , more a necessary evil . so this old girl googled proper etequette ... wow , call me clueless . i am sorry for yelling all this time . i never ... wow . high horse alert . you are on your own . this infj thinks you aren't telling the whole truth or story ... i also think you sound like archie bunker . i usually stop wasting my time at this point ... sorry , not good enough to qualify as infj . it just simply isn't . most infj's can't even recognize another infj , that is a fact . one online personality test just doesn't cut it - for anyone ... ista , i have listened to all your thoughts ... while , i understand that i do only know what you have told me ( a huge infj weakness , we must rely on people's honesty ) , i feel i know enough to help you . ... ista , how do u know he is infj ? i mistook this mirroring to mean that my esfj was really into me . being infj , nonverbal communication is as important because we look at the whole picture to decide if a person is trustworthy . this ... ista , are you asking us how to get this infj out of your life ? what exactly do you need ... infj's see so many different possibilities that we sometimes need as direct as statement as possible . react harshly , nasty undertones , to be quite honest could be applied to me . i hate that about myself but it is true . as much as i can admire and respect and love and protect , i can anihilate if ... no , we would not harm ourselves ... we don't let people close because once you are in then you are in and you could hurt us very badly , especially if we offer our hand in help and it is slapped away . well , i like to call it controlled chaos ... i like prediactability , i like routine , i like structure but i also like romance and adventure and an appropriate change in plans . for example if i were ... not everyone is smart enough to recognize this ... true , very true ... just don't kick a puppy in front of us or refuse to offer your seat to the pregnant lady on the bus or not hold the door for the little old lady behind you and we will probably get ... good luck with that , especially if we see right into you , flaws and all and decide that ( not to sound arrogant ) you are worth our time and effort and possible harm to ourselves ( we take rejection ... exactly , very well put invisible ... no use talking when no one's listening we love u , eyes closed sending u good thoughts , u have been infj'd my fellow human thus the problem with mine ... seems he must be adored and he collects adoring fans like baseball cards . doesn't sit well w / this infj who must be recognized for just how special she totally is ... he is ... just being infj , we only talk when we have something to say ? those that care about would take head to listen , i mean , really listen xo you make me laugh ! ! ! i see it as a win / win ;) missed u , bb lol ! ! ! it wasn't that we didn't see eye to eye ... he was dishonest and disrespectful and didn't take responsibility . it has made me excited to meet the right man , i mean if i can be that sexually ... hunny bunny , you know i have nothing but love for esfj . the reason i cam to perc was to understand my esfj . i've met enough esfj's on this to say that i really like you guys ... however , my ... whew ! ! ! i needed a good laugh ! ! ! i agree about making love . i would make love every day if i had the right partner . we communicate in many different ways and talking is not always easiest for us ... stop face to face ... exactly right , i lived it and i have a counselling degree and worked in a spouse abuse center ... i was in denial . it wasn't until we had children that i realized it wasn't my fault ... see , he ... mmm_dogg , u r tooo cute ! lol xo ok . am i the only infj that takes things literally here ? ? ? porn for me is watching a hot movie , my imagination does the rest ... for example , the age of innosence is very sexy movie to me the truth makes me happy not being ignored kddunn , yes , yes , yes and so very yes . ummm , this is completely false ... there may be some infj's who are but this infj would have sex daily if she had the right partner ... but if you piss me off then don't expect to get any he's obviously not a douche because he is here ... he wants to please her and know her ... definately not a douche ! ! ! awww , thanks , wildework ! i like you already ! ! ! bubbly boy , come back ! ! ! you usually have so much to say ... but , you're infj - - what you don't say carries as much weight and signifigance as what you do say ... so what's on your mind , you are ... lol ! ! ! nope infj's not needy , demanding yes , weak , no ... exactly ! ! ! thus my remark about how i have never experience gratifying , soul moving , earth shattering sex . show me respect , earn my trust and make me feel safe . then i'll let you in ... lunacyfringe brings up an excellent point - - you must earn it ! ! ! one of my favorite quotes is from clueless ( looovvee that movie ) on the subject of sex , cher says , dee , you know how picky i am ... theosophie , yeeesss . your words would be mine if i were as eloquent as you . everything you said - - spot on . there has only been one person that i wanted to rip their clothes off we both looked at ... very well said ... unfortunately , though , i have not gotten to experience gratifying sex or anything like what you have . but i am on a misson to never ever settle again and i will have a man that ... seriously , lol ! ! ! you are funny , this meets another one of this infj's requirements ! it sounds like your infj is one lucky girl ! you are going to be just fine , my friend ! wildework , you made me smile ... i don't want the juicy ( i hope - hehe ) deets but i do want to know if you guys are happy ... i hope you get your happy ever after , my hearts been dragged around ...
