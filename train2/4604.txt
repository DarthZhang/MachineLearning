' i'll let others judge the coherence of your posts . i am not concerned about ignoring them , however much that upsets you . this is you telling a story . it is not an argument , and so not a refutation . what you cite is not the claim i said i distanced myself from in my previous post . it has a completely different meaning and only seems ' pretty straightforwardly ' the same to you because of your ... no . why would they ? that's why i have said , repeatedly , that i never claimed to prove the non-existence of innate mathematical and logical knowledge . i claimed that there are no people with such innate knowledge , which ... this is incoherent . i'm sorry . last time you said this it turned out to be wrong . you'll have to be more specific . this is certainly not my claim . it follows from the fact that there are countless descriptions of ... congratulations , you've posited a generic skeptical challenge that is applicable to every empirical claim ever . i wrote that you could make this objection in two of my earlier posts , but i also ... it's not nonsense at all , and what you're doing amounts to crude conflation . i'll clarify my previous argument against it , since you apparently did not understand it or either way did not want to : ... i take it that you didn't understand what i said . in that case i'll clarify . there is rudimentary logic that is innate by virtue of a certain innate grammar that is hard-wired into our brains , but ... if it's empirically true that there are no people with innate knowledge of logic , then i take this to be demonstrated by that they need to learn about logic , which is true and observable . this was , ... this couldn't qualify as having knowledge of logic . if it did , then there would be no difference between consciously applying the definition of a logically valid argument and doing so by complete ... read the link before you spout nonsense . the grammar that is learned in school is not innate , but is derivatively constructed upon an innate grammar . this is immediately analogous to that the ... i didn't claim to have proven the non-existence of innate mathematical or logical knowledge . i said that my argument resided with the claim that there are no people who have innate knowledge of this ... this is false . language ( grammar , specifically ) is innate . it's not possible to demonstrate non-existence . accordingly , i can't show you that there is another kind of logic that is different from formal logic , just like i cannot show you that there are no ... i used your definitions , as well as mine , to interpret your claim that i didn't show any fe or ti . yours didn't make sense , but i also invited you to tell me what you meant by feeling and thinking in ... i still don't have any idea what you're talking about . a word can have an infinite number of meanings . yes , it is trivially true that if you interpret a to mean something other than a , ... no you didn't . i pointed towards you in post #323 , and you only claimed to point towards me in post #324 . since #323 precedes #324 , your claim is obviously false . where did i delete words ? ... i pointed towards you as a concrete instance , so i didn't fail to deliver . accordingly , you have provided no concrete instances . how did what i said change ? please enlighten me . i am providing a concrete instance when i challenge you to do it and you fail to deliver . you failed this time also . you're just saying that it's everywhere ! . well , if it's everywhere , then it ... i readily admit that i have no idea what you're talking about . i showed you that circularity is a general feature of definitions ; you seem greatly troubled by this fact . i'm very confused ... so when you use the term ' logic ' to describe yourselves , how do you all understand it ? most people will be using the word in a misleading way , as we have both found . this just means that those people are using it in the wrong way . if you start using the word ' mathematics ' in a way that ... i claim that it isn't because of your blatant inability to provide any instances that show that what you are claiming is true . this is a complete argument and not a mere claim . if you want to ... if you had read the thread , you would have seen that the current understanding is that jung takes ' thinking ' to be about ' realism ' . this means that , when understood properly , ' thinking ' has nothing ... you claimed that it had been made evident by things said in the thread . justify yourself . i think it is supported by the arguments i've given . if you don't think that , then feel free to show ... most people see these things in me . well , definitely the idealism . they see the logic once i've explained to them what logic is . i ignore it because it's irrelevant . your conclusion is false as per my argument , which you have refused to respond to three times in a row at this point . simply defining something in different ways ... to me , these look like fine definitions of what stereotypes are . still , if you disagree for whatever reason , then i can just refer to the difficulty of determining what ' logos ' and ' eros ' are ... theoretical stuff is not idealism . idealism is about how things ought to be ; not how they could be . my reductive account of ' thinking ' being realism and ' feeling ' being idealism seems to fit ... so then if one rejects gender stereotypes , then one rejects the distinction between feeling and thinking . supposing this to be true , it would seem that there is some difficulty explaining the difference between infp and intp . their dominant functions are both introverted , but infps are decisive idealists ... i hope you realise that it's straightforward verification of what i've been saying all along . ' thinking ' has nothing to do with logic , such that if you describe ' thinkers ' as ' logical ' , which people ... oh , i agree . it is a misleading meaning that should be gotten rid of , which is what this thread tries to do . well , that would just be because countless people have come to use terms like ' logic ' in grossly misleading ways in the context of mbti , which is what this thread is all about showing . this has the implication that if one rejects the distinction between idealism and realism , then one rejects all of typology ( at least as far as jung's work goes , however far that extends ) . my argument destroys ' t ' types as they are commonly understood , i . e . in terms of being ' logical ' or ' rational ' . given some new and extremely interesting information that has been added by ... if this is true , such that ' thinking ' really only amounts to a dispositional commitment to ' realism ' , then it really is the case that ' thinking ' has nothing to do with logic . i am absolutely amazed ... i didn't see the implication in algorithmics original post , so i suspected that it was just you who read it into what he said because you believed it yourself . lo and behold ; after a couple of ... where ? ' feelers ' calling ' thinkers ' irrational ? no . feelers get angry with ' thinkers ' for being inconsiderate , which is not the same as calling them irrational . some might call it that , but it ... the source uses the word logic , which makes my entire point . that is , unless you feel like telling me what this word refers to in the given context , which i don't think you can . yes . assuming ... no , what i have said does not amount to a mere claim . nor do i think that there is too little knowledge to affirm what i'm saying . i'll take this opportunity to construct my entire argument again in ... read the thread before you post . many have tried to say that there is an apparent difference between formal logic and ' other ' kinds of logic that are supposedly more primordial , but nobody has been ... then he is wrong . i have already given him external sources that justifies my use of the expression commonly thought . it is used by official webpages to describe ' t ' types . he asked the same ... i know he quoted me . the problem i just brought up is that his message did not contain anything that contradicted the passage from me that he quoted . i take it that there is supposed to be an objection to something i have said in the above somewhere . where is it ? what is vacuous is the term ' thinker ' . it doesn't follow from this that the ... i don't know what the line of quotes preceding this claim is supposed to be an argument for . you said this : the above clearly states that your argument follows after the : . since an ... your analogy is completely misleading . what i have said is that you need to have knowledge of logic in order to apply knowledge of logic when dealing with the world . this is equivalent to saying that ... if you had followed the external link that i gave you to support the standard understanding of what logical validity is , it would have told you that logical validity is not a property of premises ; ...
