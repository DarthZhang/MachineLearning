' this sounds horrible ! i don't understand why people have this need to be jerks for no reason . it's like people get off on this shit . maybe they hear you being self-deprecating so they think it's ok ... that's interesting that you said that . because my friend just told me that a month ago . his entire life he was scared to be homeless and end up totally screwed . he was working a job he hated to just ... good point . i like this analogy a lot . it certainly feels that way sometimes . who here is appealing to authority ? i don't think anyone here has been doing that . you should've given it a rest a long time ago and you kept pushing it . i am merely responding to your latest post . it's not that you just went about it the wrong way and lacked sensitivity , it's ... hmm i get what you're saying . but what about people you see everyday or that every time you see them they are jerks ? that was brilliant . where is this city you speak of ? nyc by any chance ? i lol with this . hilarious . that was beautiful . thanks miguel ! many blessings to you . oh , god , here we go again . alright mate , i'm out . so because i don't agree with you it means i am just doing what feels good and rejecting your all encompassing truth ? there's a big difference between doing what's easy and disagreeing with someone ... i realize that . but again , i have not once written here that i thought taking anti-depressants was the way to go . in fact i have been on them before and they helped me very little . but what you are ... i think you're confusing things . i don't think anyone here is advocating popping pills . now you're taking the placebo effect and extrapolating and calling depression a philosophical issue . i wonder where you get your facts from . show me your sources and make it clear to me why you think depression is a philosophical problem . except it's not a small issue because it can be the difference between a depressed patient that lives and one that kills him / herself . this is not a joke . when you are in that kind of situation , ... i agree , but we have science to back it up . people can't really argue with science . you can see the effects in the brain . people that think depression = being sad or down need to go educate ... daddy like . lol you make it seem like you went to meet satan and back . i'm sure hearing about your journey could be beneficial to others like me . thanks . you get it :) but it's not that i'm not ready for other ways of coping . it's more that maybe i'm not at a point where having someone tell me to brush it off is beneficial because it's not ... so what has helped you to achieve that mindset ? that's interesting . it seems like it's something to try . i understand that there's little we can control about people . we can only control our reactions . i'm with you there . i think it takes time , ... my title was that , yes . but i made sure to explain the details underneath . i explained in detail how that was a professional setting and that i was simply answering a questionnaire . the fact that i ... again . when did i say that i don't want to learn how to deal with this problem ? just because i find your solution to be a bad one for me that doesn't translate into me not wanting to look for ... cosmia similarly , in your situation , it's not your responsibility to educate this med . assistant . so what root of the problem are you looking to get at , exactly ? the root of the problem is people ... i agree with you in part . while self-esteem certainly plays an important role in how to deal with things like that , suggesting that the problem here is a lack of self-esteem on my part ... exactly . i think that's what we should have been discussing . edit : i am not asking for closure . i was looking to hear similar experiences and helpful and effective ways to deal with it . i was also ... no . the point of this post was for us to talk about it and share similar experiences as well as way to cope with it , yes . however , you telling me to brush it off is not an effective way to handle it ... i get it . i know i only have to gain in learning how to not let it get to me because it's obviously going to keep happening . my point is , he wasn't just a random person whose opinion was asked . he ... while there are people thinking that one should just brush things off and not stand up for themselves , the issue will only be perpetrated if that happens . i'm well aware that i can't expect others to ... no it can't . because it only turns the issue around and makes it look like it's my fault for getting offended with what he said , instead of actually addressing the fact that he was uneducated , ... first of all , i didn't ask for his validation . i didn't go to a primary physician's appointment thinking oh , what i nice day to make the medical assistant give me a little bit of free therapy and to ... yes i don't doubt that the environment contributes to it and my anxiety as well . i know it does . but you seem to be fixated on this idea that all there is to it is to change how you think . i am ... i repeated myself to make a point to the post i replied to . to make it clear that the condition i have is not just a matter of thinking differently . you telling me to brush it off doesn't help at all . also , you seem to think depression is just about how you think and view life . this is not what depression is . it might be a part of it . not the whole . please educate yourself on this . it's ... when you are not getting enough sleep and you stop breathing at night , you're gonna be tired , irritated and you will have more chances to also develop depression . this is not a made up thing . but i ... his message is right ? that i shouldn't feel the way i do because i am privileged ? i fail to understand what you really mean . i am sure you know depression is a real condition that impairs your ... wow . this is literally what happened to me . hahaha funny . it's not , however , that i see people as assholes . i grew up holding the belief that people are good and honorable like most infp's i believe . it was only after twenty something years on ... nonetheless , i don't think i am no entitled to that . i would use better words next time . you certainly didn't come off as sensitive . i get what you're saying . i didn't mean it that way . it just sounded like he was making fun of my sensitivity and i told him i was choosing to believe he meant something else . but i get it . huh ? i am not entitled ? please make yourself clearer . i don't understand how giving someone the benefit of the doubt is in any way hurtful . you're not entitled to say i'm not entitled to my own ... huh ? since when saying you're giving someone the benefit of the doubt is hurtful ? and i am entitled to give anyone the benefit of the doubt if i want to , sir . ok , i was thinking either you meant that or you were making fun of me for being sensitive to his remarks . it's all good , i understand it now . hmm ... i never said f = emotion ... ? i said it is about values . that's kind of what my post was about , trying to explain that f doesn't equal emotion ... which is sad . i don't think i thought like this before . i still give people the benefit of the doubt . i never just threat people like they're scum . but years and years of experience really does tell ... thank you . honestly , me too . that's why i never understood the stereotype we have of thinking everyone is good deep down . that hasn't been my experience at all . i know no one is all good or bad but it just seems that there's a lot more bad in most people around me . and do they really need to be like that in order to live ? no matter what i wouldn't bully ... i hope you are not trying to be an asshole . i''ll give you the benefit of the doubt . i always feel like they are going to mock me or hurt me somehow i feel the same way . most people seem to be assholes , so i think we sort of develop a self defense mechanism by closing ...
