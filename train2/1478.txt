' istp heh ... also very true :D do you ever get out of your dream world long enough to realize what is going on around you ? and one of the personalities most likely to be injured by doing something incredibly daring and stupid without thinking about it :D thank you ! i'm glad to be a part of this place , and looking forward to seeing more of you too :D one of my best friends is an intp female . ( okay we don't really connect on a deep emotional level , but we get along so stupidly well ) and she is awesome :D and yeah , a bit underrated . but don't ... hey intps ... so my dad and one of my closest friends are intps . and both are most certainly ts . but something i see in my friend especially ( and to a lesser extent my dad ) is that they are very ... if you weren't so indecisive all the time , you might actually get things accomplished . enfp female :) most attracted to enfps , infps , infjs least attracted to istps , esfjs , estjs i think clear spring ? not completely sure . let me know if you have any input :) procrastinating on a difficult sewing project :P esfj mom + intp dad = enfp ( me ) , estp , enfj , infp , and esfj this sounds all too familiar :P i have an esfj mom as well , and we drive each other absolutely nuts xd so i don't know that i really have any advice to give other than just let her do her thing . i ... 2 on my part , i am usually completely clueless until it is obvious to everyone but me . and then i have to hear it from the person or my friends and it is a complete suprise :P phone number's aren't a ... haha oh dear ... that was the craziest thing you have done ? ! ! ! : laughing : aw thanks :D i adore hugs ! and i think i have learned to cope with the occasional depression :) presently life is a lot of roses and rainbows . very true . :D i know where everything is . and it will get organized to the nth degree once it is messy enough to inspire me to do it in a grandiose style . i love seattle :D i lived near there for years and loved the strange-ish vibe it has . portland is pretty cool that way too hello lovely people :D what are some of the craziest and most random things you have done in your lifetime ? i hate how i have such conflicting values and priorities . i want to follow my moral code , but i get so easily distracted and throw it out the window impulsively and then spend weeks and months ... i'm incredibly disorganized a lot of the time . in my mind , there are more important things to focus on . though it gets really bad if i am sad or depressed :/ i am very introverted in some ways ... need lots and lots of space and alone time , and am absolutely horrible and uncomfortable in large crowds . but i can talk and charm a complete stranger in a matter ... you'rs so intense ! do you ever frown ?
