peeeace . and maybe a genie to grant me three wishes . hey , if any of you guys find an old lamp , can i has it ? when's the last time you checked up on the kids , entj ? the infj is twitching . because we actually believe in carrying on against the storm , unlike you ;) are you sure you're not mistaking us for you , intj ? ;) dulcinea only in the context of ' hot or not ' , dearie :P morfinyon it's because you lot are too easy to needle ... just thought it represented the nf experience nicely ;) i'm an enfp and the last post made me start reading poetry . my people ? who are they ? i went into the church where the congregation worshipped my god . were they my people ? i felt no kinship to ... boy of choice . oh , and maybe getting into college this fall ... at least they remember . you lot get drunk , go to sleep and then wake up twelve hours later . ' time to go to work ! ' i guess it's the whole ' oh , they look kind of happy and happy people are stupid people ' stereotype that most people seem to have . i'm usually an honest person , since i don't really have anything ... at the moment i'm watching death note . both l and light . well , l more since he's not a psychotic a-head , but still . reeeally can't stand misa . most people seem to think i'm slightly stupid and naive at first because i touch on topics ' others wouldn't ' or say stuff about myself that seem as though i'm giving all of myself away . this is ... infps : fifty ideas , but not a single word written down . the entp has run out of sensible things to say : i'm flabbergasted . * sarcasm * true . if adam were an istp , god would've kicked him out of paradise for being one . well , we have a community centre thing around here , and pretty much the only place to go to is the library . i've always considered libraries to be more of a safe haven of whispers and quiet , so that ... book sale cart . paperbacks going at a rate of twenty-five cents . my weakness . yes , the library here sells books . if adam were an istp , the human race would've never existed . maybe if you looked at what happened five minutes ago , you'd realize exactly why you're falling down to your death , istp . actually , yes xd it is . i made my first friends when i moved to the states , and now that i've moved back , i seem to have lost whatever it was that helped me socialize . or more to the point : i lost it ... i actually went back and edited my last post . xd it's kind of hard to ask guys why they don't want to go out with you when they shy away from you when you try to talk to them and don't really seek ... right now ? i want to be able to talk to a guy i'm fairly attracted to so i can actually move on to the next step : looking for a relationship . i fail at the former something terrible , it appears . ... omg xd mysticism abounds in enfps as well then , i presume . i have two decks of tarot cards and a book on interpretation . i do use these regularly , of course , but don't ask me to do readings on you ... seriously though , are you having an identity crisis ? xd intps : great children , awful parents . meh . today at the chess club , a young lady came to play with me but her cohorts , each of them claiming to be better players than her , took a look at my playing and said they didn't want to play even ... you mean falling over in the street from excessive drinking is called awesomeness ? thanks , but i'll pass . it's a book of herbal remedies , and i have no idea why i just paid 25 cents to get it . all i know is that when i saw it , i just had to have it ; and i'm not even a huge health nut or anything . i've ... enfps : the only type willing to criticize themselves and fail at it badly . wonder what that says about us ... esfp , stop cutting in line . and intps can't even tell you what happened in the last ten minutes because they were too busy playing the new assassin's creed . wow , an intp who doesn't like themselves . why am i not surprised ? you poor thing . when was the last time you went on a date ? esfp , have you ever even changed a lightbulb ? intj , if you didn't recognize it yet , i have a little function called extraverted thinking . if you're mistaking te for rage , methinks your te is underdeveloped . * _ * istp , are you sure ? i swear the ... istp , there's people who actually want to do that with you ? wow . istp , ask not whether an enfp can slow down for you , but ask yourself whether you can keep up with the enfp . was that supposed to be a joke ? question : what's the only thing an istp ceo can't pay ? answer : money . ( they went bankrupt before they even started the company ... by starting the company . ) i think i'd rather take an enfp ceo ... yes , entj , we can actually think factually . have you ever considered that you're the one with your facts mixed up ? sounds good--but i thought this was a criticism thread xd i'm probably not the best person to reply in this thread , as i happen to be biased . intj , have you actually considered the fact that we may actually care about ourselves and you as well , or do i need to take a hammer to your self-esteem and nail it to your brain ? we're ... uh , the reason we keep asking is because you remembered to bring all the books to the study session , but you only have one of your shoes on . take better care of yourselves , intj , and maybe we won't ... am good at persuading people verbally , not so much in the written word--but then , the words tumble out easier when i'm writing . normally , actually , i'd say to flirt with a boy , but maybe i just want to flirt with some delicious-looking hot dogs at the moment ... i'm surprised you know anything about belle reve , istp . since i work backwards when i answer--i'm a writer by intention ( as in , i'm not published ... yet ) . once i'm past this maybe a few more months , i might consider turning this into a story and ... i don't ... see , i'm not into the whole ' wait until marriage ' gig either ; it's just that i'd like to wait to get to know a person better until i let them inside my physical barriers . this is even more important ...
