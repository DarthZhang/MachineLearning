' keep'em coming :) i was thinking about this , that there are so many traits several types will deny they have , and often therefore misstype themselves . here are some examples : - a type 6 is pessimistic , but would ... this usually happens every time . and i rarely drink caffeine here is my 2nd experience of a day : anyways , would you guys agree i sound a lot more like a 9 in these thoughts than the other i shared in the op where i would say i sounded more clearly like ... - if you consider yourself a christian , you probably arent . if you think you're going to heaven when you die , your probably arent . - most people believe what media tells them blindly , but when ... well yes , learning is always good if it's self motivatied . i chose spanish in high school as an optional subject because i thought it would be the only useful subject i could chose ( among other fun ... i'm a sp / so . hi :) i would say spending time learning a language in depth is pretty useless unless you actually plan on traveling to that country often or have family / friends / communitys / jobs that you can use it ... i am one haha haha i'm laughing with you guys , because i mostly recognize my own mr critique a lot . so what do you enjoy about your critique partners / freinds ? melaniem thanks for sharing . your son seems sweet ... i thought of a 3 when i read that . was right on hehe . thanks for sharing ! purpose : show your innerself and maybe get questioned your type trough what you have written . this is pretty much a pre-post idea , before i move on to answering the whats your type questionare . ... what system is that ? i'm curious i maybe a infj rather than intj . is this the right thread to ask this ? what is the difference in decisions making with ts & fs ? because i feel that i might suppress my feeling side , ... really , why not ? i've taken 3 tests and spent quite a lot of time on them all . the quite recent one made it quite clear . what do you suggest ? she has a hard time expressing her feelings . i'm sorry , cold was probably not the best word to use . and yes , i'm sure i'm a intj . it's probably that i had more feelings for her in the beginning . and ... thanks a lot :) cold might have been the wrong explanation . she has a hard time expressing her feelings and coping with my feelings . her s is at 19 % and it was her first test , so i'm not so sure ... i'm an intj male in early stage relationship with an estj female . i wanna know what she thinks and feels . can be very hard ... how do i understand her ? how do i approach in settings to not make her ... to answer the op question . no , i'm a devout christian , and i've never really had any problems with my faith . i think its clearly the best way to live for everybody . christianity is very misunderstood ... you read about the types , and recognize the core thinking patterns . it's all about why you do what you do , and how you think daily . you can ask somebody what they think you might be , or write about ... don't trust tests . they fail paradigm i'm sorry , i might have used the wrong term . second guessing is good i guess . i'm more unsatisfied with their conclusions and the reason behind their type . my feeling is that few know to ... i would say , that the main difference is their grasp & processing of knowledge . 1s tend to have this black / white almost computer 010101 reasoning and when we draw conclusions , they can often be ... cyamitide hehe , i figured someone would say that :P i actually thought i was a 4w5 in the beginning . though after awhile , i started to realize maybe more 9 or 1 . because , those were the 4 types ... time to time again , i seem to read on this forum typical : i'm type x , but i also got x and x on my test or i'm most likely x sometimes i wonder if i'm x etc i've taken a couple of enneagram ... what type do you guys think dexter is in the enneagram ? i just watched the 4th season , i would like to see what you guys think before i give you my thoughts .
