' the istps quiet moments didnt seem to bother you ? in my experience the few confirmed entjs i've interacted with respected our style but couldnt bear the silence or downtime that istps are known to do ... dr . hill - intj the stranger - intp chris - entp josh - enfj sam - isfp mike - estp emily - estj matt - isfj jess - esfp ashley - infp beth - istp hannah - infj i've witnessed the dynamics of these two types together and what you describe is actually very similar . theres a sense of respect for an equal when i see the two interacting .. but i also noticed that ... give me 30 minutes , a gun , an apple and a box of puppies and / or kittens . it will be narrowed down . possibly one letter off who dislikes entjs ? ? only if your gullible or thin skinned i'd imagine . entjs are great in my opinion . every one i've met was considered an equal at worst . ^ ^ ^ this ! i once used my bb gun on a huge brown recluse spider and oh my god i swear it exploded . nothing left but its outline and its 8 legs in the same circle formation as if its body was still ... use my bare hands . skin to carapace , guts n all . i give no fucks haha . i mean come on the size difference is a joke i dont get it . violence ? ? they always see me as wise , intelligent , accepting , freethinker , bold even . but they also think im crazy , angry , brooding , defiant . suffer ! ! ! hahaha youd think i was a fight choreographer . haha hahahaha . you have made my day some can be pretty anal . others just like to do their thing . even the worst of them seem to be easy to deal with though . if they see your easy to steamroll then your going to get steamrolled . but if ... heat up the forges ! ! shits about to hit the fan ! :d ry : damn guys tear her a new one will you . were starting to sound like a pack of rabbit intjs . lol do you handle criticism well ? i'd say that istps handle criticism pretty well . better than most anyway . depends though . if its something we take great pride in or are passionate about even then ... yes . every day guilt or solicitation . pick one . lol bah humbug . put a go away sign up and be done with it . no . no . and no . please stop replying everyone . i cant help but reply you all back . :) woah woah woah . not giving up on you that easy . its a little bit harder than that to get rid of me . lets ... i often empathise with people ( sorry if you find that hard to believe :P ) . what dont you get ? si is my * inferiorfunction . se is one my * shadow * functions . so hardly any sensory awareness for meh . ... understand how people feel and put myself in others shoes . followed by its hard for me to relate to a sensory mind ... what ? istj's are definitely not heartless . they have feelings , just ... a few weeks ago . my wrist still hurts some mornings . ha . did i enjoy it ? yes ... and no . i enjoyed the adrenalin but i did not go with the intention to fight but to confront this enfp girl . to get ... indirect , gestural , verbal and physical . i have done them all before and would probably do it again . i guess i'm a bully . haha estp dad . isfj mom . no . honesty would mean your not hiding anything . integrity . if you have ulterior motives theres scheming involved . that is hiding things . people like to convince themselves that what they're doing is ... the supposed freak out this brain breaking you speak of . is the sabotage from actions or your inaction ? istp true neutral hahaha . im pretty sure theres been worse things in your mouth than that . besides its your mess . dont be stingy . everyday . mostly night though . sometimes i dont even know where im headed but thats not the point . stress reliever . most people are either scared out of their mind , assuming theres trouble or think ... go to their forums . not many but they did vote . hahaha . as do i , more than you know . the difference though is that hell still love you . someone not as close . say ... an acquiantance , meh :/ friend , or coworker wont be so adorable when they become ... same . but theres banter and then theres buzzkill . the banter with them is always hilarious yet profound . but not all of them can take it . for whatever reason . different upbringings maybe ? for the ... yeah , exposing their contradicting moods and dreams with simple truths and reality makes for lots of shits and giggles . n yeah it wakes them the hell up ... but dont . been there done that . like i said , ... exactly . been there many times before . the worst part is halfway through the conversation after telling them theyre wrong you realize ... they know theyre wrong , and they know you know . but they ... xnfps and xsfjs . everything i say or do seems to mean something entirely different for them . when i bother to clarify for their sake it just gets uglier . once the thought gets into their head its too ... enfj haha guilty what are you trying to say ? or whats that suppose to mean ? usually when im getting angry i dont feel like talking shhh , not now . im thinking . battle ! ! ! or just some weird sound ... i'd vote for one . but i've seen crappy people of every type in mind so .. thanks for the reply . sounds like you know what your talking about . at this point thats all i really can do haha . ill take your advice and if they still hate me ... oh well , what can you do right ? ... reason why ? thinks im rude , mean spirited , possibly dangerous . scheming even . to be honest i can be cold and confrontational . no doubt about it . thats how i am ... with everyone . but i have also never ... thats usually how it goes man . haha its all good . small beans man . why so ? i need a second opinion . looks simple enough oh boy . your no fun anyone know if league of legends is any good ? neither do i . the difference is you let it stop you ... one down . : tongue : '
