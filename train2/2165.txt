yeah no problem ummm either a girl version of flash or the ever so cleverly named invisible woman haha my favorite parts of the body are eyes haha good luck trying to put initials there :P but my second ... :) coldplay is amazing and that song is now stuck in my head haha ummm i would pick the ability to be able to breathe underwater ... but thats kinda useless in the whole saving people thing ( no ... well that raises another point that enfj's tend to have complete trust in everyone even if they don't deserve it , but we expect the same trust back and if we don't get it we get frustrated so if your ... geeze thank you haha i just realized why im being so clingy thank you thank you hmmm thanks thats a good point about jealousy ill defiantly keep that in mind but what about clinginess ? so i will admit to being the smothering jealous type , i get a bit obsessed and clingy when in a relationship . from what i understand this is typical of enfjs , how have you people kept from doing ... a big thing about enfj's is we try very hard to please everyone , from my experience if i dont like someone its usually because i dont feel the success of making them laugh or smile , it makes me feel ... hah and what exactly is that suppost to mean ? mr . random ill have you know it was a gift so i did not choose the color haha yes ! ! ! it looks like its haunted ( your welcome to join ) indeed i do , its blue but if your too loud they will bite meee : sad : : happy : take heart :) were nice aliens ... yes but shhh not so loud they might hear you other then the commitment issue what about an enfp and enfj ? you could try to find an outlet for your feelings , i listen to music while writing angry / sad / frustrated letters to whoever got me unhappy , i have yet to send one but it works really well , and then i ... i just heard you get angry quickly and react intensely , but hey :) things you hear are ment to be proven wrong bad experience ? what do you become ? oh and your aviatar is incredibly scary haha hmmm well that makes sense , although suppressing your emotions is not good i guess we can just hope the force is not strong with you oh haha well then yeah thats probably it :) hahaha next time he disagrees with you just i love you too i have heard it too haha but i have no idea , let me know if you figure it out for sure i have been guilty of doing this in the past , my reasoning was the person i always sided against could take it but i knew if i disagreed with the other person it would start a tremendous fight , then ... dont hesitate to ask for help it really is no bother , well i want to get this down before reading what anyone else said because if i dont i will forget so im sorry if five million people have already ... but he didnt turn evil out of anger more just desperation i feel your pain , i start crying if im very frustrated or angry also , no one seems to take my argument seriously after hello there ! i am from the land of the enfj's and i have been trying to figure your brains out ( haha it's not working so far ) well my question is how do you react in an argument or when you get ... sorry haha i ment to post in a different place haha :) i always just leave to get water or something when i think its getting sad enfj's naturally have a huge thing with putting themselves in other people's shoes , because of this sad movies have a huge effect on me i mean i can't watch pinnochio without crying like a baby is ... when i lock something away its usually because i want them to convince me they want to hear it , i dont feel comfortable talking about my own problems so it takes some persuasion all of the people ... when i become depressed i turn into an infj , writing becomes my outlet and i tend to write some pretty creepy stuff the only way i have found to get out of it is to hang out with people that ... haha i was beginning to think i was the only one with a thing for hands i think its the fact that enfj's genuinely care about other people's problems so when someone looks into their eyes they see true compassion and that could be somthing there not used to just try not to step on anything that could potentially cause major damage well normally this would be a compliment for a compliment but i dont know enough about anyone here to give them a genuine compliment so how bout instead you just say the best / sweetest / most pride ... i really don't like my appearance im pretty short and i have a skin condition that makes it look like im blushing whenever i am anything other then completely calm , if people compliment my appearance ... haha well i hope its not creepy because i agree hello enfp's ! im just wondering if there is a certain physical things you are attracted to ex . hair , eyes , hands , feet , elbows , knees , necks , noses ... you get the point does he eventually get over it without confrontation ? i actually gave up my dream of becoming an author for the same reason she is doubting becoming a scientist , instead i found a new passion and i couldn't be happier about it when an enfj decides on ... i am reading a lot of things that basically say whatever you do never get an enfj angry . as an enfj will admit to being easily annoyed but that usually fades quickly before becoming true anger ... sorry i tried and have no idea how to post a picture , well my avitar has had no manipulations done to it other then changing the color so im not sure if that helps ... they look better on me anyway she can buy new shoes i have no money :( you made my feet cold but what if the wicked witch comes and we run out of water ? mirrored , is this better for the wind or worse ? enfj - the teacher , he had a very very strong desire to help people and a natural ability to understand them . haha the fact that i am an enfj myself dosent hurt either 0 :) my right ear is about the same size as my left ear , and my left ear looks kinda like my right only backwards . absolutely nothing :)
