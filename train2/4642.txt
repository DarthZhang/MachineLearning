' that's my thought proses exactly . enfp cognitive entp hey , don't worry :) i never held hands or kissed a guy until i was 20 . i actually think it was better that it happened later rather than sooner . me to a t ! lol ! i'm not looking for someone , i'm already with an intj , we have been together for 3 years . and seduction had never been a problem ;) i think it comes naturally for enfp's . me too ! lists are awesome ! sometimes i do them just for fun . very enjoyable , makes me feel like i actually did something lol ! of course i knew that , but i just wasn't sure if i was on the more extreme side . how do i delete this thread ? i've been an enfp since i was taking the test at 14 . i take it every year , because in the book that i originally took the test in , it stated that as people grow older your personality can change , or ... i can't remember the name of it , but i had it memorized . it was about this little kid with a red hoodie , and he went out on the first snow , the sides of the snow banks were so huge that it looked ... i tried a search on this but nothing turned up . so yeah , i don't know if its just me or if its the same with other enfp's . i'm horribly , hopelessly , romantic . i secretly love all of the mushy , ... ace face thanks :) i still don't know anyone here very well , but i think you all are awesome ! i joined because of all the super amazing enfpness you guys have ! lol :p oh , did she reply ? my bf does that to me . i need to get stuff done , so i can wake up in the morning . ill call you tomorrow . that always does it for me , i dont want to impede in his ability to function at work . ermmm , * face palm * it's hard to not look at someone who talks a lot you really said that ? i hope you caught her in a good mood . here is an idea for you , 1 . try to catch her when she is not around ... loool ! ! ! drunk , thats how my intj and i met . and the only times he would say mushy , lovey , emotional things , and how how felt about me , was over the phone when he was drunk . we always seem to ... i really don't know honestly . but i'm pretty sure she starts with an e and ends with a j , even though my dad made her seem like an i :( go for it ! ! ! options are awesome , the more the merrier ! ! ! with me its mostly , the fact that if i don't to it ill have big problems later . ( but thats only if its a survival thing ) if its not imperative to my ability to survive , then i have problems * sigh * ... lol ! the intj's might have an emotional overload ! that might be dangerous ... i have no idea why ? i've been with my intj for three years and i still don't know why he likes me so much ! ! ! exactly ! ! ! ross sorry , but your signature ... is not the best ever :P * sigh * you intj's are so funny ... and a lot of times unimaginative . but i still love you guys , and i have no idea why . lol < ( literally i ... with me , it means that i don't know that you like me / would be interested . trying to show respect , or feel you out , because you intj's don't give us much to go on lol . and yes i am very touchy feely , ... oh yeah i forgot about the language thing ! i was teaching myself german when i was 13 , i loved it . and it helped me to get a grasp on it when i did go to germany , now i can speak enough german to get ... yes ! i am a complete nerd / geek , i wanted to be a mycologist when i was 14 , so i got every book i could on it and studied my * * * off lol . i also wanted to be a nurse at the same time , so studied for ... i'm not done with the article yet but so far its very interesting ! thanks :) with me ... very obvious heavy flirting :p emotionally reserved , doesn't like to go out / do social things , doesn't like to communicate internal goings on , likes to argue / debate everything , overly logical at times , refuses to hypothesize if it ... unfortunately and fortunately i am with an intj , i've never been so respected and encouraged in my life . but on the other hand , i've never wanted to choke someone so often . not really , being too persistent doesn't work . most times i get the job on the spot , or i get scheduled for an interview . i haven had a tv for 5 years , sometimes ill watch documentaries on line but thats about it . however , if i start to watch tv i tend to get too involved and can become obsessed a little bit . ( that is ... 1 ) sunrise or sunset ? why ? both , because i can't decide . 2 ) which hogwart's house's values do you choose as most important if you had to choose one ? why ? can't really remember which one is ... confession : i find it too hard to live in this society , and i'm mad that no one seemingly wants to change it , while at the same time complaining about how bad everything is . confession 2 : i'm mad ... i relate to # 10 really well right now . unfortunately . awww , thanks ! ! ! :) usually i just walk into a place , even if you are supposed to do it online . fill out an application there , and most times i get the job from talking to people . i'm horrible at filling out paperwork , ... i feel this way all the time ! maybe its a mental defect , but i think its true ... until i get a tooth ache ... ( kryptonite for the enfp ) usually i just take forever to choose , or i'll ask , what's most ordered . but that's rare . mostly i want something from every meal . things like how to make cordage , dry comfortable shelters , primitive fish hooks , fire , trapping , tanning hides with the fur on and waterproofing it , edible and medicinal plants , and some other things ... yeah was replying to you . :) that makes much more scene now , and i would have to say that it was definitely a contributing factor . first i saw a package of ground beef , then a packaged steak . then i saw a brown cow , standing in a field facing left , the sky was overcast and very dark . nope , i did it before i knew abort mibt . and over analyzing is an understatement in my case ! i drive a semi truck long haul , so i'm stuck with myself , ( for too long ) if enfp's made a sport of ... if someone gets raped , then the fate of the rapist is for the person who got raped to decide . abortion should always be a decision and option for every woman . a child molester should be put to ... i'm an enfp and my best friend is an isfp , i love her to death ! if we could , we would do everything together . we complement eachother very well , she calms me down and helps me get back to earth , and ... yes , raisins are evil ! i don't like raisins . why ? well look at them , they are just humiliated grapes benny and june ( sorry not an exact quote but you get the picture ) i'm curious what kind of signs enfp's have , and if there is some kind of common sign or signs that appear . i'm an aquarius :D holy pain in the butt , batman ! i have the same problem . i was ok a few years ago , and what i was doing was , i had 3 bank accounts 1 for bills and expenses 1 for play money and 1 for saving . all my ... it takes too much energy to be that way all the time . i've tried , trust me . i usually end up getting sick because of fatigue . but i really , wish i could be that way all the time ! :( oh wow ... if everyone did things like this , there would be no problems in the world . pay it forward i feel exactly the same ! you want to come with me ? i've been learning how to do all kinds of things for living in the wild comfortably :) '
