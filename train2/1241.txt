i'd be enfp . i think enfps experience a lot more joy than us generally , are generally a lot happier , and have lots of fun . they tend to be a lot more successful in every way . i can't lie ; i'm quite ... you're making a lot of baseless assumptions . overall , as an infp and someone who's been on these forums for years , fi does get shat on more than other functions . ask any infp user who's been here a ... i'm always paying very close attention to these trends and every infj i know really doesn't like te ; they don't have it anywhere in their stack and it isn't very complementary . they tend to find it ... nope . just stating what i've observed quite extensively over the years . good luck finding an infj who will date you longterm ... they aren't fans of dominant te . i see infjs ( and not the mistyped infp kind ) quite commonly , romantically with every nt except for entj . uh no , i'm not a troll . i'm stating what i observe . you're that butthurt by my comment that you're going to report me ? yeah , you're definitely an entj too :: eyeroll :: . yeeeah , sorry but you haven't seemed like an entj to me in any of your posts . highly doubt you are one . and anyone who isn't totally deluded will notice from these forums that fi-doms get shat on ... there's a difference between animals killing eachother out in the wild and prolonged torture in a cramped facility , obviously . and one can care both about people and about animals . also , we all need ... the one thing personalitycafe has made abundantly clear is that everyone hates fi-doms , mainly infps . no one wants to date them . yeah yeah , everyone likes enfps . we all know . are you in a romantic relationship ? if so , with what type ? actually i've only seen infp 9s with other nfs longterm ... they're the only kind of infp i've seen with enfj or isfj for instance ( although theyre also very commonly with xstjs ) . i think infp 4s need ... i like charlotte gainsbourg and alexa chung's style ... chic without trying too hard . good materials ; not tacky , chintzy or matchy-matchy . i think all type 2s are extroverted feelers , but not all are extroverts . see : isfj , infj infp-istj is actually a very common longlasting relationship but only with a certain enneagram of infp . do you know your enneagram ? that's so interesting . where do you come across those estps ? i feel like i'm never anywhere they would frequent ... not that i would want to date one . maybe out of 20 infp 4w5s i've talked to in longterm relationships ( a few years or more ) , 18 are with intj 5w6s and two are with entj 3w4s . infp 9s most commonly seem to end up with enfjs , ... i get a strong exfj vibe from her . she's definitely warm it's hard to say . she's definitely ixfp and lately i'm leaning more towards infp because her songs are just so dreamy and reference the past so much . isfp work is much more concrete . i completely agree . infps are the pinky toe of the world . it's unfortunate but we need to develop ourselves with what we have . what fi adds in depression is far more than anything positive it adds . interesting because i think that anything but complementary relations tends to be very difficult over the longrun ... there needs to be a basis of understanding aka it's best to share thinking and ... i'm not personally invested in the trends working out ... they just have worked out that way . in fact , i eagerly look for deviations from the trends but have only found one or two examples of it . it's ... i think a mixture , and this is why so many infp 4w5s end up with intjs ... we share fi and te so there's that shared understanding , but they can bolster our te ( and the te isn't too extreme ) + we're ... lol i'm very aware that trends don't predict things for everyone , but when you've talked to many many infps about relationships and they say the same things and are with the same types over and over ... enfjs are only really compatible with infp 9s we are all humans , sure , but why then are there such freaking strong compatibility trends ? why then are there literally no estp-infp relationships to be found ? i would love if we were all special ... i know of two infp 4w5s in longterm relationships with entj 3w4s . the infp 4w5s are very well-developed ( have pretty strong te ) and are quite career-oriented . well developed infp 4s can almost ... i wish infps could date infps as successfully as entjs date entjs ... i'm not that user but i've heard about two infp 4w5 relationships with entj 3w4s . these infps are super well-developed and seem to experience a great relationship of equals colbert seems like an obvious entp to me . sooo similar to so many entps i've known . he's always super energetic , whether in character or not do you know of any infp-entj pairings ? btw how did you decide you're a 9 and not a 4 or 6 ? double check here if you'd like , because that would drastically change potential compatibility : ... infp 9s seem to be much more versatile in longterm relationships than infp 4s ... i see them a lot with istjs , enfjs , estjs , and isfjs . very occasionally with entj . they're all with enfps ! is she kind of angsty or more of a really chill , peaceful type ? cool ! yeah , i figured . i have only ever seen infp 9s with enfjs :) given that you're an infp you're probably more likely a 9w1 . one really big difference between 9w8 and 9w1 is that 9w1s fear ... if it's going to work the entj needs to be receptive to sensitivity and emotions and the infp needs to be tougher than most . if one or both are underdeveloped it obviously isn't going to work . ... bigstupidgrin did you decide on your enneagram type ? do you know what your enneagram type is ? i don't care about the relationships that didn't work out , see op oh interesting , i didn't think infjs could be threes ! seems pretty incompatible with the mbti type . yeah i have a really close infj 9w1 friend and she's so much more easygoing friendship = wise than ... lol that's funny infps thicker skinned than most when it comes to vulnerability ? whaaa ?
