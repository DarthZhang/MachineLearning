i know people who don't like to take life too seriously and would rather be out there making jokes than discussing theories or reading ... there're different kinds of intelligence out there . the esxps i know have amazing social and concrete intelligence and i think these are important things to have . they don't have much of an abstract ... no i always enjoy reading your posts teddy , you seem like a mature well rounded person . unfortunately , the ss i know irl tend to take their traits as granted and seem to think its the only way to be . as ... yes ! that was awesome i am attracted to assertive guys but dominent guys are not for me . i do tend to fall in the passive side but i'm not submissive either . i wasn't talking about infps in particular . i was talking about my dad's opinion that either you totally conform or you don't conform at all . i do agree with your point though . well an extreme example that comes to mind is wearing clothes . most people do wear clothes and its generally considered as normal . i agree , conformity does have it place and adaptibility is one of the most necessary traits people should have . at times infps need to get out of their heads and know what's practical as well . what i ... i'm sorry if i'm making a generalisation but are esfjs usually very conformist ?
