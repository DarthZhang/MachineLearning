if you look through the lenses of what you want to see instead ... . i can see entp and infj , but there's no way he's an infp . he is way too logical and extroverted feeling . i don't know if you've ever seen one of his lives shows where he just talks for an hour , but ... any dominant intuitive is going to have trouble paying attention a lot because they are stuck in their heads . an ne dom does gather ideas from the outside world more than ni , but they are still ... you know you're an intuitive when you see an alpaca-goat like concept and try to make shapes with the air until a hero rescues you from the inevitability of choking on your own loneliness while ... okay okay okay . i just came back from watching a bunch of videos of him , and i can now see him a lot more as an infj . i don't really know how to feel about this . it's weird . i feel like i've really ... where exactly is that ?

he seems like a total ne dom to me . all the effortless witty banter and sass in his live shows , def an ne dom . if you watch him talk , he doesn't have that ni ... thanks everyone . i feel a lot better today , cause i got more sleep than i usually do . i don't normally get that much . it's much easier to function when you get enough sleep , just hard to do . i trust ... thanks . i am kind of an internet addict - getting off the internet would probably solve a lot of problems in my life . hard for me to do though . hi , i'm an infj who is still in high school , and for some reason my biggest fear is getting trapped in a job i hate . i guess it's the ni in me that is always thinking about the future . i can very ... i guess i still technically am ... but i don't know . i feel like i've lost my intuition , and that deep , mystical insight that i guess we're supposed to have . i just feel so cut off from everything . i ... isfp . i'm tired of contemplating , i just wanna live life . enfp hands down . exactly what i was thinking . the only thing that's throwing me for a loop is that link is definitely a j and most likely an n , which wouldn't be ne . but they've been best friends since they were ... i'm thinking so , too . although rhett stated that he was an introvert , i can't imagine him as one . maybe he's more in between the two . i was just wondering the same thing , haha . if i were to guess , i'd say rhett is an entp and link is an xnfj , most likely enfj . he's definitely not a p . if you watch enough videos , he talks about how ... so these guys have a total of like 700 videos . here's a couple videos ( rhett is on the left , link is on the right ): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXm3xyuFItk ...
