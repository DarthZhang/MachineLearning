' i find istj's are more organised and remember names and dates better than intj's . intj's are much better at solving problems and arguing constructively . can someone please give me a practical example ? i don't understand this function . imagine you are looking at a bottle deodorant in a store and analysing , why the colour , why on this rack in the store , why the smell , why the ingredients , how was it made , who brought it , how many ... sure you're speaking about intp's . i and the other intp's never post quotes . that's an intj thing . i laughed and my boyfriend laughed harder . i get distracted so easily by things . i thought the same . intj's i know are very cynical and can be too straight forward at times . p i do and obviously it bothers you too , otherwise you wouldn't have bothered . the way you say it actually makes it sound interesting , let me know what the end result says please . i know a few intj's and they are much more sarcastic then us intp's . also more cynical , they just don't have broken filters like house . sorry no candy :( ok , so i've read that we have our own worlds . what's in yours ? mine mostly have people in them ( clever people ) . so this has been discussed numerous times before , however i was wondering how you guys can conclude that house in an intp ? he doesn't fit at all for me . i would say intj . from my experience intj's . getting all philosophical annoys me . ignore them and focus on those who find you interesting . no offense to you , but you need to get out a bit . even intp's need more than mommy social interaction every now and then . my i just point out that majority of people have brown hair , so that will probably be in majority . yes , weird wouldn't you say . my theory is that it is all the thinking that we do , makes us worry and makes us sleep less , thus more dark circles . your score : 42 0 - 19 = low 20 - 39 = average ( most women score about 24 and most men score about 30 ) 40 - 50 = above average ( most people with asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism score ... lol . thanks . i was looking for it , but couldn't find it . do you guys like books / reading ? curious if it's also an intp trait . i love it . i've been told before that i have a look that could kill . so i suppose that counts ? i have learned to deal with them by saying thank you , however i wish people wouldn't ' give them . it makes me feel awkward and i wonder what the person wants . a dolphin or a man . house is definitely intj , he's too organized to be intp . i didn't take offense . bluntness is also an intp trait i believe ? i just tried to point out with this thread , how people often mistake personality traits for adhd or other illnesses whatever they may ... sometimes adhd is used to explain personality traits which the medical profession does not understand . i am certain i do not have adhd . i have no problem concentrating when i have to and i do well in ... lol . no . i just read it and found it funny that i displayed those traits . i don't really believe i'm adhd . i'm speaking of actual depression , not necessarily what looks like depression . that i can relate to , i enjoyed learning , but not necessarily the way in which it was done . close enough ... interesting that both of you were bored at school . i did really well and enjoyed it , although i hated the idiots sitting next to me in class . wondering if it is also a personality trait . my favourite people are intj's , infj's , isfp's , enfj's . i like them the most of all the types . infp's . those are basically the personality types i naturally befriend i get like a drooling puppy . all the extroverted feeliness comes out . i don't even mind being hugged in public . do my friends like superhero movies . i often lie , strange that that is all our problems and for some reason people tell me their secrets hehe ... i am also good at manipulating people , but they don't realise it . for work i have to dress up , it's expected , however when on my own , i walk barefoot , often in jeans and an old t-shirt and i never wear make up , no one has been able to make a perfectly rational ... guys , they don't get all mushy on me and they don't talk about boring things such as hair and make up . so here's my reasoning . i suck at explaining so bear with me and i'm to lazy to quote my sources , that i'll do when i feel like it someday . basically i read that majority of people with autism are ... i'm just curious what / who intp's end up with . i am dating and intj , the conversations we have are awesome . together for over 6 years . i laughed : tongue : , just thought i'd share ... my sense of humor i suppose . i fit almost all of the below , the joys of being an intp ... :d ry : adult add / adhd : signs , symptoms , effects , and ... i hate feeling like a social reject all the time that the the world doesn't get me . i would love to be another type , not sensing though , too much detail for me , but an infj would be awesome . i love ... what i hate about myself is the fact that i lose things , what i hate about other intp's is they are always late . most annoying . art , music or chemistry . i'm almost a qualified ca ( accountant ) and i hate it . infp , he definitely feels morality and he isn't scatter-brained enough for an intp . isfj's not so much but esfj's annoy the living hell out of me , i hate that everything is all drama with them . that ginger cat got me all feely . i want that kitty :( ... puppies get me all mushy , that and dogs doing cute things . lol . sorry about that , if you can just vote twice , one for right and one for left . or pick the hand you initially wrote with , that is if you developed into being ambidextrous ? not sure what you mean by targeted , from what i've read and the connections i've made my suspicions are that many intp's should be left handed , possibly more so than other types . not solid , but based on medical information i read , more like a semi-quick hunch if you want to classify it as that . i expect to get a significant amount of left handed answers . one of my best friends is an infp . i find your type to be over emotional and very irrational at times . i can't really deal with that . my suggestion is that if you want him to give a damn about your ... idiots . i really cannot stand them . beggers also pisses me off .
