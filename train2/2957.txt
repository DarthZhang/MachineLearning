lmao please bring out yugioh cards ! ! ! as far as like transgender folks , i'm good with that . if you were born a male , and identify as a woman , then there you go . its not that difficult or interesting enough for me to really contemplate ... i think intp type of women probably have a harder time keeping a man's interest . a lot of men are selfish sorry but its true . they want to be taken care of , have their ego stroked to some degree ... it depends on the person and mutual interests . i was in the car with my boss's boss the other day for an hour . i asked the right questions to literally have him going the entire time while i nodded ... i'd rather be happy personally but you can have both . balance is key . some people od on living in the mind which is not only probably an obstacle of happiness but an obstacle of searching for ... i actually have a chance if going into the fashion industry doing cool things but i'm effing nervous because it will be sooo many women and i'm just not like most of them ( not like most men either ... i like this thread ... chameleon effect and external factors have a lot to do with it obviously . i think society expects men to be more selfish in their intellectual pursuits . people want me to be ... me telling a white person such as yourself that you basically have no place trying to understand black issues was not politically correct at all . ha . the opposite actually . i would never do that in ... just going back to this again to say that not everyone is afraid of being called racist . white people might be concerned with that but it's really not necessary for white people to explore whats ... this thread is disappointing , kudos to caged within and effy and others though for making real sense ;) you kind of implied that it didn't by saying victimhood is self imposed . how can a victim mentality be self-imposed if you are in fact a victim of racism ? i think you choose to place too much ... lol . : wink : hmm ... this was very informative . maybe i'm more extroverted than i thought . woo . jesus , come on you're better than this . it has nothing to do with political correctness . as a rule , i generally do not engage in trying to convince white people racism is a real thing , but i just ... again how much time , how much of your life is spent in black communities ?
