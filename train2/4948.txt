numerically i lean towards being a late 2000s kid . however , i consider myself both a mid and late 2000s kid . both of those eras were just as important during my core childhood . i also spent some of ... since i live in the southern hemisphere , it's a bit easier for me . i would defintly say that early 2010s culture peaked in the 2011 school year . then i would say that mid 2010s culture peaked in the ... yup , your right . when referring to the ' 90s ' , it basically means any year with ninety in it so bascially 1990-1999 , however you are correct when you say that the 10th or final decade of the 20th ... lol true ! ah well , not gonna affect me anyways since i'm class of 2017 : wink : i'm 17 ! : cool : sorry , i'm gonna have to disagree . also , this chart seems to over analyse things . let's not get too picky though ! 2002 borns are 50/50 , as simple as that . : wink : ok . that's fine . the point that i was trying to get across was just that being born in the 2000s doesn't automatically make you an 00 ' s kid . : wink : you do realise that's not how it works : rollseyes : . being born in the 2000s does not make you a 2000s kid , because people say born in 2009 can't even remember the decade . 2000s kid : born 1993-2001 ... i would say your a 2010s kid , but your free to think otherwise . meee . 2000 to be exact . tbh i have no idea , becasue i will be an old person in like 2080 ! and i have no idea what the world will be like then . there's so much time before then for stuff to happen . i'm pretty sure mine was 1 . 2016 2 . 2015 3 . 2011 4 . 2010 5 . 2012 6 . 2017 7 . 2013 8 . 2014 it's just ridiculous , seriously gen y is only 14 years long but then gen z is 26 years long , what ? ! ? only 6 more months until i'm officially an adult ! ( technically ) : smile-new : cool ! ! : welcome : haha , your childhood went from 2008-2017 , have fun while it lasts note : this list is not a definition of what era your childhood peaked in , it shows anyone who was in any part of their childhood during that era . early 00 ' s : 2000-2003- - born 1988-2000 mid 00 ' s : ... i consider 2007 to be my peak childhood year . :p ride : it was a great year ! yeah , 1997 borns are the ultimate 2000s kid since they were in their childhood for every single year . yeah becasue nostalgia seems to go in 10-20 year cycles 2000 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC3y9llDXuM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-KmOd3i7s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow just asking what makes you think that 2013 was the peak ? :d istracted : maybe because it's more recent , people remember the time better and more of us were around them , i don't know but that's funny because britney spears is more of an 00 ' s thing anyway . no one said you were though , we all know that you had some childhood years in the 2000s , but the majority was spent in the 2010s . therefore when someone is trying to distinguish you between a 00s or ... well , i'm born in feb 2000 and i guess also consider myself the end of gen y . i'm not sure why but that's just the way i feel , i could also be influenced by my two older sisters and trust me it ... oh wow ! rip . funny first memory though , i always used to play that game on the n64 aswell , except that was when i was 7 . well if i wanted to be technical , then i was alive as we entered the new millennium which actually started in 2001 , but i know what u mean lol ! one of the things i hate the most is when everyone ... crap ! i hate thinking about that . we are also closer to 2030 than 2002 ! completley agree : joyous : well i actually have some vivid memories from age 3 believe it or not , does that mean i think i was in my core childhood in 2003 , well no actually . i think childhood is more defined by the stage of ... your mum should have turned it off literally everyone i knew had an ipod touch 4g back in 2011/12 lol ! guess we just have opposite opinions then . i think 2016 was great ! : cheers 2 : as previosly mentioned , i'm pretty sure most people agree that ages 3-12 are someone's childhood years , not 5-12 . so i guess my childhood went from 2003-2012 using that definition . also , i think at ... yeah probably 60s . i think the 00s definitely changed alot too . depending on what aspects you look at though . yes but that was his whole point , he was older at the time then you who was only 5 . people who were younger at the time are going to get more nostalgia for that year earlier than others simply ... ikr : suspicion : , seems kinda random yeah ! you had 3 years of your core childhood in the mid 2000s and i had 2 years ! ( 2005/6 ) haha : encouragement : well if you were born in 2004 , the only year of your core childhood in the 2000s was 2009 . at this point in time 2010s culture was starting to take over 2000s culture anyways . just my opinion though . for me , 2013 was easily the worst year of the 2010s . if you remembered the 2000s well enough then you would have known the ps2 was much more of a thing during the decade than the ps3 . also , please stop saying that you became very mature ! ! your were ... i was born in 2000 , therefore my core childhood was 2005-2010 , so i get childhood nostalgia way more for the 00s than the 10s . but i was preteen / early teens back in the early 10s and there is no ... what about your perceptions of gen z ? you identify your teen year withe the early 2000s the most ? ! ! : laughin : hmm , being born in feb 2000 , i don't think of myself as being a ' partial ' 2000s kid . i just consider myself as a 2000s kid simple . my childhood took place in all eras of the 2000s ( early / mid / late ) ... why do you include 2011 but don't include 2016 ? ? i was born in 2000 ! : redcard :: redcard : it's simple , 1993-2001 born being 2000s kids and 2002s being hybrids : m0827 : ! at least that's what i think sorry , i completely disagree with that :d ry : ! i personally think that 2005 borns should definetly not be considered 00 ' s kid . they never spent one of their core childhood years in the 2000s at all :) yup , the 2011 christchurch earthquake happened just a few weeks after i started intermediate school aswell , strangely though i cannot remember it maybe because i didn't feel it or it didn't affect me ...
