( not meant to be offense ! ) yeah , that might be true ... but then again everyone is different ! i don't mind an older best friend , but in terms of girlfriend-boyfriend age counts . hmm , yeah that's probable it . so who wants to be my best friend ! =D oh , i see . but no ever seems to care what i have to say , and am sick of having no one to talk to , no seems to care about me . i was thinking there might be a chance that there is a infp that's ... i feel lost and lonely and i really need some one to confine to , share my emotions without getting freaked out or look at my as if am an alien . just some one who is kind . it's just i never had any one to relate to so i might as well start with my own type . reasons why ! there cute ! there romantic ! they are easily adjusted ! they can share my ideas ! there calm ! easy-going ! avoidant of conflict ! make life dreamy ! make me feel comfortable ! i lost so many things just to get a girl to like me . =( i spent a year trying her to fall in love with me . i felt like i did not exist or if am still not existing but whatever i have chocolate and ... you know whats funny is that i made a bio on myself and gave it to a girl ! she smiled at me ! mmm that tickling sensation ! you can't type a ninja ! there xxx ! : crazy : we should all go on an infp date to the cafe shop ! : cool : see i knew there where a lot of ninja's in this forum ! : laughing : so what side are you on ? the ruthless pirate or the merciless ninja , maybe you are a fabled prinja ! i hope you vote wisely i heard there are a lot of ninjas in the forum ! dum da dum ! : wink : that's some awesome advice , but i decided i would make my wench a lovely love letter ! : cool : thank you some much you gave me an idea ! oh how i love you ! thanks again for the idea ! : laughing : sad and awesome ! :p roud : : crying : very sad . true that , i think i kinda confuse girls at my school alot , they think i like them , whenever i do that shy smile , which is hard to control , because i only do that when am excited , embarrassed , or ... what a motivational speech i enjoyed it on to the next thread ! : cool : so you basically going to disagree with the other infp forever unless your opions match . so if i was you i would be the mature one and say lets be neutral , and talk about subjects you guys like .
