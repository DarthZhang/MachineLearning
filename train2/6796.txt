( in reality i have probably recalled a ... i love anime ( for the most part ) . however i am not as completely obsessed as some of my friends are . i've never cosplayed or gone to a convention or anything like that . but , yeah especially when ... definitely intjs . they always have something interesting to say . yes ! why is it that every time i want to say something i find that somebody has already said the same thing i was thinking ? i would never want to be anything other than an infp , but then again i ... i looove anime . i've watched : 1 . ) fullmetal alchemist 2 . ) naruto ... i understand what you mean . many people feel that they are in-betweeners and don't know what to make of the system . while some people definitely have the ability to pinpoint what type they are ... wow , this has really helped me understand some things . thank you ! i've never heard of an esfj villain . i know ! i feel like i'm asleep during the day , but so alive at night . that's the only time i can think clearly . no . i'm sure that there is probably one type you are dominant with . the trick is to figure out exactly which type you are most like . i completely understand what you are saying though . i go ... that's true ... i was also more outgoing . although i am not sure if that meant i was an extravert or if i was just less shy . what i was really getting at was that i don't think that the family ... i live in a family of sensor types , so sometimes i feel alone . my mother is an isfj and my father is an istj . my younger sister is an isfp , so i can somewhat relate to her . but sometimes i wonder ... i do a lot of evil things ... when no one is looking . drink soda right from the jug , cheat on tests , and lie . in fact , i lie a lot about a lot of things . and yeah , i would read somebody's diary ... my own thoughts ... and it's started to give me a headache . maybe i should turn on some music or something ! okay so ... i've taken a test gotten the result infp . however , too often i find that i am not as accepting and flexible with others as an infp should be . in arguments i generally take a cynical / ... i have a hard time meeting other infps . it's like the only place i can find them is online ! although , i suppose its possible i just haven't payed attention enough to notice somebody else of my ... it's nice of you to welcome ... however i already feel overwhelmed at the amount of unique ideas people are sharing . it's almost as if ... people are stealing the words right out of my mouth ... he's an interesting person ... he can sometimes appear to be completely some sort of st . but so often he seems to express an extremely emotional side as well . that's a tough one i believe she is an isfp.they are defined as artists who are keenly in tune with their 5 senses . they are often credited as being pioneers in new trends and ideas . fi is definitely her top ... i would say either estp or esfp . i doubt he's an intuitive because he seems too in tune with his 5 senses and aware of his surroundings to be one . i'm gonna guess esfp , they're definite people persons if i am at home , i curl up in a ball in my bed and turn my ipod on . the music really helps me to distract myself . the other thing i enjoy doing is getting my notebook out to write . i find that ... i think most people are drawn to religion simply because , it gives them an answer . humans are naturally curious creatures and we want to know the answers . as an idealist i can tell you that i've ... i don't know ... i personally like them very much . they are generally very considerate and loyal people . i think the reason that people might not like them as much sometimes is because sometime ... i can always see the logic in a situation . what i cannot do , however is make decisions solely on the basis of logic . in other words , i can identify logic , but i don't always like to use it . i ... i agree with most of those . however , i always thought of naruto as not an esfp nor an enfj , but an enfp . but that's just my opinion . he seems perceptive about others , while still being ... i'm the one who is always alone , but never feels it . i am the one who actually sees who you are underneath . i'm the one who is the most cynical ; and yet the most optimistic in every situation . i ...
