' hahahahahahhaha i'm awful . i look at the title : what do sensors think and i think inside my head : nothing . hahaha , okay , i get your point . at least i'm nearly an intx , right ? or at least enough to pretend it . biology definitely has a place in this , i agree . why oh why can't we just model ourselves after the wolf pack , where the most dominant wolf regardless of gender is alpha ? or take birds of prey - ... children ? ewww . haha , just kidding . really , though , kids aren't on my radar , and i'm not looking to have any . ideally , whenever i think about it ( which isn't often ) i guess my partner would ... oh hey , if i'm a goddess , i need a title ... can i be the american goddess of hair braiding ? actually no that's lame and underachieving . i have it ! * drum roll * the american goddess of ... i often become my shadow to fit in with groups , to hide my reserved / cold mask so people will accept me . especially if there are people in there i want to like me , and subconsciously realize they ... i absolutely love your patton quotes . he's something of a inspiring character to me , so it was cool to see someone else post his quotes :P the most popular of all intj quotes : i came , i saw , i conquered - julia ceasar what is good ? all that heightens the feeling of power , power itself in man . what is bad ? all that proceeds from ... so you go to the computer to fill out information for an entry , but your parents are totally : um , no , we didn't make a decision ! as a judger - how do you deal with perceiving parents who are slow ... strategic contender makes sense ... especially because i'm much better at making plans than i am at following through . (; wow ! awesome input , thanks everybody . and i have to really agree with what snail said about not taking away anybody's masculinity or femininity , but accepting them for it regardless of ... oh my gosh ! she sounds just like my dad , and i think he's an entj . he reads labels of companies out loud as we drive by , is an awful backseat driver whenever my mom drives , comments on movies as we ... in the equality that their needs are provided for despite their gender , basically . that we are equal and the real difference is that of our individual minds , and not the stereotype the world puts on ... oh , the intj , absolutely . who else is independent enough - materially and emotionally and physically ? xd women's rights have been fought for and against since the beginning of time ( or , at the very least , the american revolution . ) but i want to your opinions on it , in depth , why you are for it , or why ... whether she realizes it or not , she's afraid of trusting you and ending up hurt and betrayed . maybe she's had bad experiences or maybe it's just instinctive , but cracking her open is going to be one ... it is . we were made to touch . studies have been shown of babies in orphanages who are bereft of touch / cuddling and they die - their systems can't take it . they simply need touch . i wouldn't ... the biggest stereotype is definitely the no feelings / emotions one . we have feelings , we just don't necessarily display them the same way other types do . 2 . intjs are always evil . really , that's ... my three biggest ones are animals , writing , and reading , but i also enjoy messing around with my dad's nikons , debate , philosophy , music , kayaking , braiding , researching topics of interest on google , ... the way i see it , the genetic pool is already crappy , so why add to it ? what is so alluring to girls in staying at home and changing diapers , cooking supper and folding laundry , when you could be a ... shrubber first off , no , i did not mean to ignore you , i simply didn't get on for a super long time because i've been so busy . lame excuse , but it's the truth ... anyways , on to the debate ! i ... sometimes i wish i were extraverted . i would make life a lot easier / simpler . but at the same time i like being introverted ... maybe it's the conceitedness it me , but i'm happy being a mastermind ... it's logical , well-put , clearly formed and defined and makes sense , with no contradictions . ( meaning i agree . ) by making it against their very nature to cheat . to make it impossible for them to cheat , just like it's impossible for humans to fly without being on an airplane / synthetic wings . as for ... hah , i got a chuckle when i read the last few posts - every seems to abuse their lips . (-; heck no . the more girly and extraverted you are , the more feminine you seem . true , but at the same time all the real housekeepers are sensors ... i personally find sensing to be more feminine ... true but if you have to make a priority it needs to be humans ... it depends on the interaction . if it is positive and i am content and included , then yes , i am stimulated . but when it's negative and i am ignored or in an uncomfortable situation i am very drained . this one thought has been on my mind for a few days , and i think i've come to my conclusion for now : if i could change one thing in the world , what would it be ? the most popular choice i've heard ... woah , all of the above sounds a lot like me ... it's not necessarily apparent to others who don't know me very well when i'm stressed , though , i just freeze up and look threatening . : kitteh : hahaha brilliant ! i have hardwood floors too , and i used to do that all . the . time . freakishly fun . that looks very interesting ! by the way , i couldn't help but ask what type of camera you took these pics with xd actually i kind of like vampires ... estj , or some es-type , but personally i'm attracted as hell to intps . ^ ^ they draw me like ants to honey . it's not a physical tiredness , more like a mental weariness that i think comes from describing to others the brilliancy going on in our brains ;-) however , i've been able to stem the weary flow by ... what's your idea of a pulse ? sexual tensity ? and grabbing the dick idea won't work , but thanks for the thought . maybe that'll work down the road . ;) hahaha , i got the j - felt really weird putting my hands behind me with my eyes closed and wondered what the neighbors would think xd abstract me . i play the piano and sing but it wasn't my choice , my parents made me play and i was born with my vocal chords lol . sigh ... yes , classroom . > . < and good idea . the cool thing is he has this photographic memory . he can watch a julian smith video and remember everything in it , when i've seen it ten times and can't ... that's the hard problem ... we're nearly always in a classroom setting . > . < it's a very small class ( 6 peeps total ) making it much easier for me to interact with the two other boys . meaning when i talk ... thank you ... a lot . i haven't really ever tried to identify many other personality types except the people i am specifically interested in ( self-centered snob , i know ) so i can't pinpoint how intps ... lol and i hate my girly-feely-side is rearing up it's ugly head ! i can personally testify to the lovesick feeling . i apologize for being the cause of it but am selfishly glad you have helped me sort ... defining cues ... shit . i'd be freaked out to use a verbal comment , lol . i suppose the cues from me would be paying more attention , complimenting but not flattering ... damn , i'm so close-knitted ... damn , you guys like making it hard , don't you ? > . < then again it's not like i make it any easier ;) that's why i like to keep it at friends ... until i start analyzing it too much , and that ignorant ... i start picking my lips with my fingernails until they bleed ... a habit i've been trying to get rid of , but sadly , it comes back in viral epidemics . and if i try to chew the inside of my mouth , it ... true , or dealing with them for that matter ;) if you see this , how would you react to the girl making the first set of moves ( basically showing you she likes you discreetly ) ? do you think you would ... compare them to the entj . nobody gives us any credit . if there was some kind of award ceremony for the types , intj would win smartest , and entj would win the meanest and most unethical . oh , ... hahahahaha ! thank you for giving me the biggest laugh of a very , very crappy day . first , ask yourself why people kiss intj asses so much . you would think we would be outcasts - we are cold , ... muchos thanks , tyrant . and of course , i wouldn't be interested in him in the first place if i didn't find him intellectually stimulating , and , of course , a challenge to understand . (; what would ... ( haha , snap , this is four years old ! * gasp * ) '
