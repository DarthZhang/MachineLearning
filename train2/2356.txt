' i have a perverse interest in that show and thus seen a few episodes . i like the idea of clashing the values and live styles of two different family's to see the reaction . sadly the producers take a ... i find i am one of those people projecting an image of myself in most cases . i twist myself ever so around each person to best fit them . it is not a positive thing but i have only called out on it ... daria clanned six feet under my little pony : friendship is magic death note i do sometimes , yes . once i know a person enough if they will find me funny i tend to humor them . other times i do / say things to humor myself . gotta have that balance . i personally would not want someone to try and affirm my masculinity . i am not even quite what would entail . i don't consider a especially masculine or feminine person . such labels i find can put ... that would be devastating . i would probably get rather depressed about that . on the bright side i would use that situation to move to another country and start a new life . neat question . as a whole i don't get bothered enough by people to be critical of them but will take notice of some thing which bother me in other . such as those whom are close minded and ... i read a bunch of descriptions and hung around here for a while before signing up and officially labeling myself as such . i feel as if i have great potential within me i just need to figure out towards what and how to channel it . i believe in the ideals of feminism greatly . gender equality and breaking being sterotypes of gender are both important to me . sadly many people think feminism is about women rights over mens , thus i ... for as long as you can numb yourself to it . people have called me chill . my intense side is something i feel is more hidden and possibly underdeveloped and i am not capable of articulating in a verbal manner , under the fast pace of most ... enjoy life one step at a time . i bet there is something right now exclusive to this current time period that you can enjoy . be is your friends or whatever . the thing about the future is that is will ... the confusion you have caused will not deter me . i like the full name . in the past i used to prefer the shorter version and went by that for years . since i had the chance i tried to start going by my full name . i catch people using the shorthand ... my name i just came up with at one point . it just sounded nice at the time . my avatar is lumi from the game child of eden . it's a great , underlooked game that made me feel basically how your avatar ... those were my snap thoughts before i thought it threw . i took it as saying you don't want to be a type as a judgement of said type . that is not necessary the case . it's merely a fun thought ... last weekend i was at an convention for the first time . it was a fabulous experience that reminded me i need to get out of my comfort zone more often . thirsty and a little antsy . that is a harsh thread idea . i love being type 9 but that does not mean i'm grateful for not being other types . not i . but i don't wanna say something like that . i have no clue about my future and probably won't at that time too . court . i understand that . lol by itself can be interpreted so many different ways . non face to face , communication is not ideal for that reason . is person it is so much easier to keep something going as you ... it's a short hand and commonly accepted shorthand for something being funny online . a part of me wants to look down on it's use , as i see all internet slang as lazy . this however is a unfair ... mine is just a plate of nachos i made one night . i feels it gives off the impression of someone whom is not too serious and is fun . i guess my advice is to get a picture that presents a part of ... i'm cool with what i got . that said enfp would be neat , sometimes being introverted can feels like a barrier . in my teens i spend a sizeable period confused about myself . unsure of who i was exactly and what made me tick . i would second guess myself and think i was faulty . it was self hating behavior . i felt ... have you ever had chips wrapped in bologna ? i remember eating that once and enjoying it . several years ago now . i would be surprised were i not type 9 so what up ? the question i ask myself now is my desire for a cause genuine ? like , do i just want a cause because i feel like i should have one and want to fit into a certain group ? i have no passion , and am ... that is the main thing said about infp's that has me doubting . i do not relate to infp being crusaders for a cause they believe in . i wish that were the case , as i feel like i am drifting and have no ... that makes a lot of sense when layed out like that . i don't really focus on sensory pleasures much at all . i have put some thought into isfp as one of my types . infp was always my main bet , hence why i go by that . why do you say i show no s traits ? combat boots are rad . i spend my adolescence playing video games . i'm feel like my taste in games in rapidly changeing to more creative and less violent games . i got bioshock infinite , and am liking thing about it but ... what does this service entail ? i bet that answer varies greatly but in general . i am not trying to control anything . people are free to do as they wish , that includes joining the military . i am not the most knowledgeable person on the subject anyway . i would truly like to know ... joining the military is one of the last things i would do and don't understand why the decision to do so is looked on with such respect . like to join is such a inherently good thing . what do you ... right this moment ? not at all . to train them is my cause . sorry but it was too easy . thank you for the response and for reading this . i never thought of myself as a thinker type . i may just have misconceptions about t's is all . i'll look into those two types for sure . i signed up for this site a while back and did some exploring of my own . due to this i believe myself to be infp . however i second guess it sometime and do not know the functions and all that ... i don't really put a lot of stake into it . pursuing a relationship is not my style and has not worked out in the past . i dislike all those silly dating rules and thus avoid that stuff altogether . how ... i don't care for them . please don't tickle me or hide and try and startle me . i don't like when people notice i am jumpy and pray on that . i never really had much career ambition . when i was real young i wanted to be a wrestler , so i've been told . pretty much all my friends are male . well , i know females but not to the extent i hang out with them alone or anything . it has been this way since i was about 10 . before that i have had closer female ... probably been asked that a couple times . what annoys me is when someone learnt that i have done drugs before they have this look as if that makes so much sense and helps explain me to them . i tried ... i actually sort of relate to that . as a teenager i jokes with myself that i would not get past 20 . i am not a motivated person . i'm still trying to figure thing out .
