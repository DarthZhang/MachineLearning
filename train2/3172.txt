well , we often fail to realize what will make us happy . fame , money ... those are things we often seek , yet it isn't where true happiness is . you're sweet . <3 i miss having faith in humankind . at times i hang around the interwebs and discuss with some people ( usually guys ) . then we meet up irl ... and then , they just lose interest . be it a ' friend ' , a boyfriend ( happened once ) or friend ... i can relate to this way too much today . :( life sucks sometimes , i gotta agree * hugs * when i feel sad , i think and read about humans . and then i get sadder . obviously not a terrific strategy . damnit , me . stop be in your introverted-sad phase , that's been 23 years and it's about ... here it goes again : depression . i've read books about this before ; and i experienced this before , too . so . i know the way to go . i know there's only one way out of the tunnel . the truth is , ... i kinda miss posting here . <3 just took this photo this evening . i don't even like it , but heeey . what a better way to overcome my perfectionism ? the more i learn about psychology and human nature , the more i enjoy working with computers . oh , hi . it's been a long time . mutism , anxiety and laughs . i have very few certainties about myself . but i know this : i want to build things . useful , useless , beautiful , meaningful , random things . that's about the best way i've found to express myself . i feel constantly pretty sad those days . i need to get myself back up . i need to stop overthinking over matters that only generates sadness and confusion , and get better . i need to stop saying i ... haha , right ! life's a bitch and tyrion is great . words of wisdom here , sir . partly seasonal , partly not . it's kind of ... life makes me anxious , and anxiety makes me depressed . so that's like , hey , it's a trap . yeah , i know that trick ! ... yet , it doesn't make it easy to ... it's cold . the more i try to get out of this neverending winter , the more it seems that i'm never getting out . i struggle to help myself ; yet i know it's the only way to get myself out of this ... sadness fills me in . social interactions are exhausting to me those days . pretending to be normal is tiresome in the long run . i also suck at being a good daughter taking care of her sick mother . i'm in a very ... hahaha . ha . i've done that a few times , but those days i've just spent increasingly less time here . so i'm not as curious . strangely , doing that online doesn't feel too stalker-ish for me . doing ... maybe it's time to follow my own advice and begin to voice myself more . be more honest , and more transparent . admit my own shortcomings ; and say that it's okay . and whether it's okay or not ... i didn't either . i agree ; that's why even ( / / especially ) dreamers need pragmatism . i'd delete them directly from the subconscious . incorporating new elements into the existing memories would be a better and safer way . i wasn't trying to be practical here though . they are just ... most people don't understand social anxiety . i don't think they care either , anyway . that's what - may - happen when you internalize bad experiences . well , figured that if i had access to the ... ^ thismustbetheplace i have to second everybody else . we never actually talked directly much but i really enjoyed reading your posts . they're relatable , and so are you . you'd be missed if you go . jogging outside can be great cardio too . :) just answered anonymously to a question how can people fall in love with someone over the internet , through text , when they haven't seen each other both physically and through camera ? on quora . ... i used to have a lot of silly beliefs . or really , lies i enjoyed to believe . i thought that everybody meant every word they said . that promises were so important that nobody would ever even ... aw . thank you very much . i'll check it out for sure . :) i will rewire my brain . i will create new thoughts processes to break free from my anxiety . i don't care how long it is going to take ; it will happen . the human mind is insanely powerful and ... for christmas , i will ask for soft plushies . i miss having loads of plushies around me while sleeping ; and i don't care how childlike that seems . plushies are awesome . do you hate promises ang long-term commitment too ?
