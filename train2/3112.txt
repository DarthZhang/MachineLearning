' ive recently had several sleep paralyses while having nightmares . its kind of amazing , but awful . when i saw it on the tv , i was like wow . then i was like , thats so cool ! then i looked at all the people dropping form the building . i was amazed , thinking what itd be like to fall from there . bat . they are more intelligent than humans , and the only chores youd need to do , is , catching bugs . you do realize , killing others is normal for animals . how is that different from us ? we are just like animals . but with technology . how can you overlook the brutality that nature documents prove ... oh my . i always wanted to know , which it is . the void , or the otherworld . yay , i get to know it now ! * tail swaying with excitement * what would the world be like ? what do you think , the world would be like , if it were the intj's who were most common ? alright , so this thread isnt explicit to infp's , but i thought it has the most meaning to us . so , what do you think is unique , and what is not ? do you strive for it in a way or another ? if so , ... does this look good on me ? i wouldnt know . should i put my scarf the other way ? your hosting an alcohol drinking party ? count me in . we are going to take a walk on this great sunny day ? im in ... tritype is so cool . its a shame that its hoccus poccus , like astrology . i think time is essence . i would not waste thinking my time is useless . its what i live for , my time , that is . if you oppose what gives your life its essence .. then you dont want to know what i ... i would criticise you , but there are too many isfp's . alright , so we all have irrational areas . whats yours ? for me , the question of who i am , is the area where im most irrational in . i can easily type others , but when the question comes to my ... but i got tired . = | i think its estp 5w4 so sx . so sx's are known for their contemplative nature . why estp . is , cause . well , looking at my profile , it seems like the stereotypical estp gone wild has written it . i mean , ... well , those who see me , know , that i tend to change my typings all the time . i was just thinking , that theres no enneagram i am worthy enough to poses . ' * sniff * , i cant be that , i wouldnt live ... i .. am seriously getting angry with this . time after time , i feel empathy without knowing its empathy . i mess up my whole world by making decisions in my thinking according to how someone else ... alright . so is this the bane to you as well ? ive found great value from subjective thinking , but it took me like a life time to realize , that theres value in it . soo .. what about you ? ( to ... well , i used to make alot of threads , but i dont any more . = | alright . i dont think im the only one . so , anyone has ideas on how to spend time in the webs , and stuff ? ahh .. any skype rooms on perc ? cant find any interesting threads in perc .. = s enfj - insane cult leader oh , are you referring to obama ? =D what about the inventor of atom bomb . intp ? alright , the title says it . tell us , of unlikely evil ( possible ) traits , associated with type xxx . ill start : infj's , the angels . at worst , blinded by vengeful hatred towards people who arent ... laser hands . so i could kill anyone who smokes . what ? does it look like i own an alien laser pistol or what ? but ive done it with over 5 dragons of both gender . a wolfhuman thingie , oh and .. oh , i mean , this all counts , right ? =D alright , so do you personally correlate emotions to ennea ? like , a person of xwz is more likely to feel this and that . so , feel free to blabber , thats what this thread is for . no idea . i imagine , you know it since its your idea ? i have no idea what this is . but i voted yes . infp : two plastic bags . its a fine trekking bag , that i use for shopping in the local market . hitler or jesus .. hard to say . alchemy . jesus changed water into wine i , change youghurt into cannabis ! =) id put the whole tritype into same category as astrology . in other words , i believe the whole tritype theory exists only , because we all can pretend other enneas , as fluently as if we really were ... simple mathematics . each ennea has 5 attributes . the must be at least one superego in each ennea . to have three enneas in one person , would mean , that tehre are people with six superegoes . or six ... i think youre from a whole different planet than i . you dont grasp my words , i dont grasp your words . i think its quite fascinating . looked your profile . an intj . that ni-te thinking can be ... you cant tell ? =D ( ' hmm , that must be a joke ? ' ) you have over 14000 posts and you still think that the opposite wings are that similar ? why couldnt any ennea find their id obscure ? look , ego is separate from id in all enneas . they way i ... the way i experience id is , as if it was completely irrelated to me . i just feel that there are wants . i either observe them , or analyze them . i dont relate to my wants at all . and to begin with , ... i see you dont grasp what im talking of . i never said its enneagram 8w7 or 8w9 . it could be any enneagram with ties to ennea 8 . thats what im talking of . i do not think its shallow to ... alright . let me explain . im here , quite confused , because i dont believe tritype to be real . why ? it would mean , that there are people with six superegoes . i could never imagine that being possible ... so you only find your eye targets only mildly attractive ? i would too , if i talked about humans . dragons , however .. alright , so this thread isnt what you woudl first think when you read the title . what this thread is , a careful analysis how different morals , can be correlated to different ennea attributes . so ... alright . say what ennea is the hottiest , and say why . no whys means out whys . so say why . this is specificly , the word ' hottiest ' . my answer is easy . 5w4 . you have seen the movie eragon , then ... the welcome text : since you arent figuring it out yourself , you must be a sensor . tell me , do you play electronic games ? ( yes means t and no means f ) in the games , do you own , or are you ... mostly when its related to , how i amaze others through finding witfulness from areas others wouldnt . quite stereotypical for 7w8 ' s , if you know of us . i mean , technically my ego is 5 , which means ... compliments regarding how proper i am , or of how intelligent i am . i dont really thrive through compliments . if i know it myself , thats enoguh . it seems , people feel this too , as i dont really ... hmm .. im not quite sure that i grasp the difficultiness of such situation . i could imagine having a need to be with others . but as long as i just can lay down ( i mean literally , not mating ) , then im ... ahh ! let me check . about two years . however , ive been some more years into typology than that . i do have friends in my friend list . though i dont use that list much . im quite shy . ive been ... oh , you love me . is that a compliment ? * a slap to the face * i always look at this thread while browsing new posts . and i _dont_ think , but i think without thinking : i dont think . im trying to browse these threads . how could i think while doing so ? purpose .. its a fascinating concept . i think i gave up on purpose years ago , after i lost all hope . i live on something else now , something intanglible . as i think , i do not find any purpose . but ... a : they dont . b : quite the opposite of the word you used . c : if you want an insta ban and a moderator to laugh his ass off , yes . D: it seems not . people tend to be quite pervy . also another ... help your intj out of a rut ? i believe , the planet rut is their very dear , home planet . why would you take their home away ? joke , to those without an eye for a joke .
