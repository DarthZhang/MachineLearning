i'd say my sense of humor is a bit different than most . it's fairly dry , intellectual , and dark occasionally . now thats not to say i don't find silly , stupid things funny . some of the simplest things ... maybe it'll be like that . i'm sure there will be more to it though . depending on how we acted in this life , how we accept whatever the afterlife is , etc . funny , my friend and i actually talked about this last night . we are both lds , and whenever people talk about the afterlife they say it's gonna be a paradise where we will be in the presence of god ... what i bolded especially hit home to me while i read it . i usually withdraw from people after they make me annoyed , upset , disappointed , whatever it is that i feel , because if i don't , i'm fairly ... if someone ever said this to me , i would listen quietly , then rip them a new one so hard . i can actually see that quite easily . it actually happened to me this past year . my best friend who became my girlfriend was an f , and made me a lot more touchy , and more affectionate , verbally and ... you could just say thanks , i really appreciate it . save love for extra special occasions and people . thats what i do . maybe that makes me a bit machine like ... i dunno . i've tried . like i said , i'm kinda just done with him . i don't need that in my life . edit : like now , he just told me how stupid i am for wanting to reconnect to a childhood friend . wtf who does ... my experience with my one intp friend , is that we became friends because back then we were both loners , so we kinda just stuck together and built up our self-confidences and slowly accumulated a ... distract them somehow . find something to take their entire mind off of their problem or situation . they will never completely forget , but if you can manage to get them to use their brainpower on ... if hes similar to me in the way he talks , pay attention to what he says . i slip all sorts of underhanded comments or jokes in my speech , especially in small talk because i have to make it interesting ... from recent memory , a couple things could make me cry . like leyane said , sometimes after a perfectly horrible day , where everything has gone wrong , or over a period of a couple days or weeks where i ... hahaha , yup this is pretty much me exactly nowadays since i've got a pretty large group of friends i'm comfortable around . the only way someone could tell i was an intj , is if they noticed what one ... hey , some of us can be adventurous , light and fun at times . granted most likely when she first meets one of us thats not how we are going to be , since the intj won't know her , and therefore wouldn't ... oh the k . i . s . s . principle . as i've gotten older i've learned that that is usually the best advice when trying to explain myself to others . quite often i find myself start to try to explain something , ... i'd also like to add to blue soul ' s pretty accurate description , that possibly look for someone that is a bit withdrawn , and when they do make comments , they act like they don't really expect anyone ... i'm actually trying to figure this out myself . i know some people have remarked that i must be a grim , dark , or depressing person since i love rainy days , but honestly , rainy days make me really ... honestly that describes how i feel about rain in a way i've never been able to explain it . i try to explain to people i know why i love the rain so much , and i always end up just saying because it ... strange , you just described my experience to a t . literally thats how my first love went . after talking to her just once or twice , we were both just captivated with each other and would always go ... 18 as of last week here , actually pretty surprised there are 2 other 17 year olds in here . anyways , not quite sure what you're asking about subjective intellectuality , but as several other people ... the amount of people i've met that do this to me . i don't understand the need to continue talking to someone that basically isn't responding to you , then thinking it was a successful conversation and ... i'd have to agree with this , although i see most intj's either being in erudite or dauntless . i personally would choose dauntless for myself , simply because anything else would get boring after a ... you're reply i've agreed with the most so far of any , i'd say my highschool experience was pretty similar . i was usually pretty tired at school , and just half-assed it the whole time . first 2 years ... i had a good laugh . funny thing too , your description of the esfj , pretty much what happened to me . she fell in love with my at probably one of my lowest points , trying to fix me , etc . once i was ...
