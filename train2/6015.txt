thanks for the advice - i'll ... as socially awkward intj - i need your help dear infps . i have an infp friend , who was my shoulder many times . i really like him and i though we have great relationship . well ... i knew he ... as socially awkward intj - i need your help dear infps . i have an infp friend , who was my shoulder many times . i really like him and i though we have great relationship . well ... i knew he ... for me the feeling is mutual ! the feeling of being able to be myself without the necessity of watching every word , and without walking on eggshells is so consoling . your open minds , full of fresh ... magnetic enfj - huh ? i would take one of any age ! they don't want me though .. i see you took me wrong - i like old guys as friends , i'm not looking for a mate ! lol they are always wise - so i ... i don't know many of them : i have enfp girlfriend - she is stable friend . i believe that we can nicely balance the small friendship breaks : her need for exploring someone new , and my need for some ... i totally agree that fe-fi differences are important . i hope it would be that easy thought ! i feel automatically understood and connected to many fi users . then - attracted to many fe users - just ... it is a shared feeling - i do share it also , but i believe it is coming more from the uniqueness of our mbti type . but - i love to attract old guys ! they are fun , sweet , charming , safe , wise , i can ... it is not something we do everyday - meeting in-laws :-) prepare ... find out their likes and dislikes , passions ! find a common grounds and focus on things you can like them for . it will suffice ... so try to look this way : controlling emotion is our strength . we have learned it for years , we know it . people dont like when you tell them about weaknesses , not strengths . so , when you call us ... 1 . the lashing out - i can not talk for all intjs , but i can lash out when some problem builds up for some time , and you touch it . it may be something between me and you , but it may be some other ... you think that because you are fe user . i totally agree with statecraft demystifier - when we are out of control - you should call us out . you look angry . can we talk about it tomorrow ? - ... : happy : can not wait ! i believe i will like your nt style ! i am nt as well : happy : i believe i know what you mean . i think it is incredibly hard to translate feelings into words , the way that ... i'm polish too : wink : it is a song ... anita lipnicka do you mind to share some of your poems ? i knew / know only two entps , so i'm looking forward to see what you are describing here - very interesting observations ! i would need to know more of entps ... it is hard for me to even imagine what ... that's how i see entps - they are just perfect flirts ! but they show clearly that this is just game , just for fun , sparing of forces between man domination over woman , and ( mostly : wink :) woman ... this is spot on ! words of wisdom . please continue one without the other is never good enough . when you shoot for kindness - be wisely kind . when you shoot for intelligence - do it kindly i'm still learning to accept it - definitely it is hard ... i believe that's the one of the reasons why people see intj as cold and non-emotional : when i see a big potential issue coming - i'm ... now i understand better why you are so great ! suffering ennobles ? : laughing : would you share how do you deal with it ? i have enfj boss ... i'm sure you relationship with your father is similar - with ... i bet he adores you ! i adore both my infj friends - they are not emotional neither dramatic , as infj filter fe through n first . i find infjs very gentle and caring this is spot on : laughing : as i value internal harmony i developed a system for this types of dilemmas . when my feelings want something strongly , then my ni takes over and calmly states : brain , ... intj forum and injustice ?

you used perfect word booyou : laughing : it is dangerous to force intj into something ! if other people would force me to be warm - they would get smiley antarctic treatment . i'm ... it depends . with infp and enfp friends - you would feel my fi - if we would be in one to one settings . generally - with a group of more people or neutral acquaintances : well developed-fi intj ... it is sad to hear , as i really like infjs . i don't think you can make him a friend within a short time , we call friends people we can rely on , not the sweet talkers - if you are trying to be ... i'm sorry - you are right . 1 . i believe i have proven many times that i know who i'm talking to - so your statement , that you are not intj is not necessary and disappointing 2 . answering honestly ... do you really doubt ? how many times i have to prove myself ? ... i know the answer ... i don't need it . it should be valuable to you what i need - is only open honest communication and mutual trust to understand your point it would be good to hear what does it mean to you ? i have the same impression ... for me not-understandable was also waiting for someone loved ( or even expecting ) to be betrayed by existing gf / wife , with purpose to be free caring about someone's feelings , wants , thoughts , need and stated in the past needs is something else that caring just for idea of caring fe-type . honest talk would be nice . or better - honest ... i'm an old intj and i think you are incredibly wise for your age rexmaximus ! you have much more information about the whole situation and a clear vision , and you should listen to your intuition . like ... it looks like this whole situation is hard on you ... i feel for you ... i believe you have very good understanding of situation and you just need to get some distance first and prioritize what you ... happy about nothing . - i really appreciate your response and your insight ! it is so very helpful and i wish to talk to you and i don't know how ... let me tell you why : enfj i'm talking about , knows ... no worries , i know it takes time . you'll be stronger and will do it one day ! i'm sure you was thinking about your anxiety and depression a lot , and as you know yourself you know better than us how ... i really appreciate your description about how enfjs treat emotions - i totally agree with it ! i had to take some time to understand why you took my words really different way that i intended , ... go for it ! block your thoughts , pretend it is not you , take chill pill , drink before , take a friend , do whatever you need and go for audition ! any audition . you can do it ! i see you are really down ... though this may cheer you up a bit , this is a good description of enfp ( enfj - in my opinion ) man : ...
