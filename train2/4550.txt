' trent reznor eh ? that's cool ... always dug their music . especially closer of course . i would imagine there are a few famous intj musicians . probably more along the lines of instrumental music rather than any including vocals . i can say that i thoroughly enjoy playing , and listening ... outstanding http://youtu.be/VqKjIT1ECZg yeah exactly . i think two good examples of an intj serial killer / mass murderer would be the character gerard butler played in law abiding citizen , and the character kevin cosner played in mr ... ^ i like the detail and depth . 8/ 10 http://youtu.be/2_97N3DNBs0 http://youtu.be/Pib8eYDSFEI ^ what the previous poster said . not sure if this thread will go anywhere , but i've been reading through quite a few articles today about the aurora massacre and thought this may possibly be an interesting topic to be discussed ... well there are only a hand full of anime series that i'll watch . i watch those for ; art , character development , fantasy , story etc ... i do find there to be deeper meaning in some , not all . latest http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7259/7569398102_d65d2882f1.jpg untitled by bp_carter , on flickr haven't seen the movie . original ( old ) is excellent imo ( for exception of bath scene ) . that scene turned a lot of people away ... a bit awkward . the story and character development were outstanding ... berserk imagine that . http://youtu.be/sDI6HTR9arA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnwfTHpnGLY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S35THmZD_E pretty much the same here as the majority has stated . i generally stay away from partying unless it is with close friends which i have history with ... and if i do party i get pretty well sauced .   ... yes . this is how it always is for me . interesting reading through this thread . i was thinking about starting a thread similar as i have a learning disability myself . i was diagnosed with adhd as a young child . i started taking ... tooboku : this reminds me ... it pisses me off when someone invites me over and while i'm in their home their damn dog keeps jumping on me ... they yell at said dog ... said dog keeps jumping over ... yeah , hell i'm an intj dude that wears bright colors sometimes . who woulda thunk ? in my opinion it doesn't matter . people should wear what they want to , and be themselves no matter what ... sorry to hear man . next time you'll get it right . big fan of kissing here . i almost enjoy it better than sex . almost . i like a teasing kiss at times too . nibbling and such can be fun . :p roud : ^ + 1 for being an interpol fan . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTdcEoBLEuk ^ what he said . these are torture . any kind of get together for the most part . especially family reunions . : confused : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD87Hbm9mrI i really dig this video . antiant haha , some more good throw backs right there no doubt . do you enjoy 80 ' s tunes much ? honestly , for whatever reason i've never liked really any 80 ' s ( that i've listened to so far ) ... same here . i'm always a happy / silly drunk that becomes much more socially normal . that's the vibe and feedback i get anyway . damn , freak nasty . throw back ! remember 69 boyz ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbxi9hxctk8 or how about luke ? @ antiant very cool . i'll see if i can't think up some others that i've stumbled on here and there . always great to discuss quality music with like minded individuals . personality cafe seems ... when people don't use their friggin blinkers when driving . how hard is it ? really ? you know you're an intj when ... you make it a point to park in an end spot because of the reduced chance of door dings . i do this everytime ... everywhere . family reunions . ... and for when i feel like jumpin ' around ... or just feel like listening to some quality experimental rock ... oldschool deftones gets the job done . lots of memories from the third song .   ... thanks for sharing some quality beats . listening to this sort of music helps clear my head believe it or not . i really liked the second yelworc and fabrikc . exocet was pretty ... well you have a great smile . : happy : when i smile in pictures i have to have someone around that i tell to say something funny or else i can't smile . that's just the way it is . true ... http://i332.photobucket.com/albums/m349/lostreality_album/c06e3e9c.jpg figured i'd post a picture of me actually being myself rather than being normal and forcing a smile . so here's me ... my thoughts exactly . i agree , and second your request for comparison . darkewe : care to oblige ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBKHsy-Jy-8 this band reminds me a bit of stabbing westward , nine inch nails and maybe even some korn . really good stuff in my opinion . they never really made it ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjykvEmgiw http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2AVC-KYaQ here's another good one . i would also like to add that these guys are crazy in concert . scene it myself in a small rock club here in jax . really ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irDPhuavNtA not the actual video . this guy just made a fake to go with the music . didn't do a bad job for the most part in my opinion . the band is ... ah , i see . yes , spamming of course . get to work ! : wink : just realized that i didn't check out your profile before asking if you were from ireland , lol . oh well , my bad . just sent you a visitor message . : happy : haha . you should've seen it in person . ten times funnier . that kid is a lot of fun , but boy does he get away with murder , lol . hello and welcome . so you're irish , eh ? ever been to ireland by chance ? i ask b / c i am irish as well and would like to take a trip there sometime . always nice talking to those who have explored ... hello . in my opinion i think that people seek sex for many different reasons . with or without meaning . i agree that sex with emotional meaning is definitely where it's at . however it is also ... welcome ! as a fellow intj , i can relate with the anti-social bit . i'm still a bit new here as well , but this seems to be a great community . i've always wanted to visit sweden . i'll have to ...
