i think this one is particularly suitable for infps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieSq8moVOG0 http://i1146.photobucket.com/albums/o528/TheGreenRussian/59015_475372585774_591855774_7203359_7541052_n.jpg ... it is a wonderful place . may i recommend le huitième jour ( although unfortunately it is very difficult to find ) , the beat that my heart skipped , the diving bell and the butterfly , le diner de cons , la question humaine ( i ... sylvain chomet's the illusionist , waltz with bashir , the diving bell and the butterly and le huitième jour all caused me to cry . http://i1146.photobucket.com/albums/o528/TheGreenRussian/58962_475370950774_591855774_7203270_6430405_n.jpg ... http://i1146.photobucket.com/albums/o528/TheGreenRussian/58214_475372300774_591855774_7203347_3367981_n.jpg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpamxmzgw1w not mine but classic youtube - del preston : del's story absolution or origin of symmetry , showbiz and black holes and revelations are both good as well though . have you heard the resistance yet ? i thought there were a few good songs but it wasn't as good ... fantastic ! : happy : what's your favourite song ? welkom ! are you a muse fan ? * hugs * for everyone ! youtube - the pogues streams of whiskey youtube - sigur ros - hljomalind youtube - elbow - the loneliness of a tower crane driver youtube - manic street preachers - this is yesterday ( with lyrics ) ... i'm not sure how valid this claim is but i have been told hitler invaded russia based on the advice of an astrologist . waltz was good as landa and it was occasionally amusing but it was far too long and tarantino once again indulges his passion for mindless violence of no artistic merit . johann hari - archive well done : happy : come back soon ! your posts always seem to be insightful . all of us : laughing : youtube - sad eyes - bat for lashes youtube - untitled # 1 ( a . k . a vaka ) celebrities should be regarded with a mixture of pity and curiosity rather than hated . i think you deserve it : happy : perhaps your functions are quite balanced . i think you should go , staying will just grind you down . albert einstien priceless is worth a look , although depending on how good your french is you might not want to have to watch subtitles . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lktd1OBHVI don't worry ! virginity or lack of it shouldn't relate to self worth and it doesn't make you any less of a person that you haven't lost it . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4f4oy2M_Og http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dFVJ904OYs&feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g5kUBwVbCw&feature=related i think people deal with grief in different ways , just because you didn't cry doesn't mean that you didn't feel very sad and there is no need to feel guilty about it . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utNisPM9_0w if you're delusional maybe because i said nothing about looks or talent yet that didn't stop you from another hysterical over reaction . i bet he could almost feel the cash in his hands . the judges don't decide who wins . i'm impressed at how you can manage a commentary on a program you have never seen . well i suspect you were looking for something to attack because in no way did i ... i didn't say it was fair ... d'oh ! read it properly and stop inventing things to attack me , it's pathetic . the way to win these things is to have a sad story , last year's winner beat far more ... does she have a sad story ? if not she's got no chance . is that the yarra river on your avatar ? i thought we were on jupiter ? welcome ! :) how can you analyze a book by the cover ? if you've never read one i presume this is the only way you can . : laughing : are you serious ? some would have been but back then the majority of people would have married because they were pregnant or because they were forced to , not out of love or in higher society out of political motives . no need to swear ; one might mistake that as a sign of desperation : wink : yes people were allowed to divorce if they wanted to become disowned by their families and become outcasts in society . i never ... no we lived in a society that allowed people to be abused and trapped in loveless marriages . stop idealizing the past ; you are basing it on a ludicrous rose tinted view of things . biblical marriage ... why would you want to go through with a ceremony that is emotionally meaningless ? it's just a way of sorting out property and the like . so if someone makes a commitment and their partner dies what do ... well the whole idea of marriage in the first place appears to be as a legal one rather than spiritual / emotional . in biblical times marriage had nothing to do with love , it was to do with property so ... when people are young they do things that they later regret or change their minds about . there could loads of reasons why people don't get married , what if their partner dies or breaks up with them ... i bet you wouldn't make generalizations like that about racial or religious groups . you are joking ? well seeing as you know nothing about the circumstances you can't really make that judgement .
