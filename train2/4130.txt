maybe i missed something ? but different strains do different things and they each are good for what you want . sometimes i sit and chill . other times i like ... my mentor is esfj . he is an engine builder ( motorcycle racing ) . basically , esfj's want people to be consistent and thoughtful - at all times ! lol . i dont know about relationships but we are ... everyone is on point with their comments . the only thing i can add to this is do not judge / compare your relationship with any of his others . when i was younger , most of my friends wouldn't understand ... well , as someone who has been through hearing similar things from dating i feel a strong connection etc , that sort of thing . i don't know . i'm speaking for myself here . i got along with those ... i think that you keep saying you don't have expectations but if you re-read that post , you do . you expect him to communicate on a regular basis and take charge in meeting or scheduling dates . all ... so the istp is a liar . why even be friends with someone who isn't straight with you ?

you mean reactions . i make decisions calmly . i react with anger . there's a difference . if i am responding to something out of anger , i generally will not regret the action but i will ... they are just young and inexperienced . i wouldn't put much thought into it . istps learn the hard way about social lessons . they'll figure it out . until then , just ignore it . i think most people on ... already settled . first , you won't like it - even if you're ready for it - if it's not with the right person . how do you know it's the right person ? that is for each individual to decide . having an ... so , this sounds a lot like an istp a bit out of his element . let me tell you , i got promoted to a management position a year ago . i went from being a damn good employee who did my job to being in ... enfp . best relationship and most challenging ( in a growth way ) i've ever had . we have a perfect balance of strengths and weaknesses . we are each others yin / yang . the old saying of when you know , you ... he is invested and probably inexperienced . no ultimatums . bad idea . if he gets flustered when you're trying to explain what you need that means he is not hearing you because he is panicking ... i have been with females but don't like to label myself any which way . i like what i like . i've been with my male so for over a year now . one thing that i know is nf's generally seem to like us . i ... well , i thought his statement was redundant . i never had an issue with our time spent apart or together . i thought it was well balanced and still do . ( my reaction was : huh ? ) i do think it was a mix ... update : i spoke to him but i didn't plan on doing so in this way . still it worked out . i picked him up from a bar ( he was drunk ) and on the way home he says do you hate me ? caught off guard i ... thanks for the response . he had said something similar . about not being needed . i don't need him . i do want him . isn't that better ? i would hope he could ask for what he needed . i would do my best to ... i don't blame him for me being depressed . for a while , i couldn't recognize that i was until a little while ago . i didn't know it was affecting him bc he never really tackles anything he deems ... my so of a year and a half recently said something to me during an argument that has me perplexed . imnot going to go into specifics but we both work for the same company . i recently got promoted ... sounds like a fear of failure . it's difficult to fail but necessary for success or knowledge to accrue . take baby steps and have doable short term goals . get used to completing those which you are ... people are strange and i think we just don't bother breaking that down . or at least , i don't . i just don't think on * that * wavelength . if i wonder about a person it is more to answer what kind of ... wow . very well said . i wanted to add that i think this is a younger istp problem . early teens and twenties were the hardest part of my life . what is funny is you will find that you are more male ... your last question answers itself . you have to be ready and desire to give . you have to be able to be vulnerable in order for a relationship to work . don't try to force it . you cannot look at ... very true . we work well as friends , playmates and confidants . i don't think two istps are the best matches for each other romantically where you want a balance to your strengths and vice versa ... i work as an apprentice in a motorcycle racing shop a couple days a week . specializes in engine work . i manage a high volume restaurant as my full time job . how i learned ? i went to school for ... i don't know their type . i do know i gravitate and seem to instantly like most enneagram 7 ' s . mbti type isn't as important . the only other enfp that i'm closest to is my best friend . she's a 6w7 ... i either really like the type ( mostly e7 ' s ) or this is exactly how i think the others can be . you don't need to justify or explain yourself superfluous . it's cool . there are quite a few threads on this - quite recent . my so is an enfp and if you look at my past posts i'm sure you will ... i understand why you stated this goes out to the istp christians ... as those who do not believe would not understand your struggle because they have come to their own conclusions already . to each ... my first boyfriend was an istj . not boring at all . my mom is also an istj , so i know the type well and enjoy their company . they generally have a good sense of humor hidden . but the main difference ... do you know what area or field you would like to work in ? i got my a . a . by just taking online courses and two or three classes a semester until i just knocked it out . you don't have to decide your ... ha . i think now would be the best time to get to know him . maybe that's just me . i like the long game and no pressure . if this person is interesting to you and you have an ability to know him ... i don't consider myself a victim of anything . circumstance is not personal . it's just what is . for me , it's fairly easy to accept . i can only change how i react to it . i don't have a kid . i don't see why i wouldn't accept him or her . i'm pretty sure i'd have a clue watching them grow up that it wouldn't come as a big shock anyway . i would definitely teach my ... i went but never finished . i don't regret it . everyone who responded above covered every base . you got spot on advice unconventional . burn bridges to build better ones . nothing wrong with that .
