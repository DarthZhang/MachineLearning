' wow . this nails it right on the head for an infp . . meaningful flirting ? we can just be ourselves as we focus on the needs of the one we're flirting with ( i mean , not that you cant be silly at times ) ... so funny ! i use to hit those i liked too ... didnt work for me either . i wonder why ... now i just philosophize them to death ... that dont word either . lol perhaps you're asking the wrong question . . for me , flirting is easy , but the emotions and thoughts that accompany flirting ( and i'm talking about someone who i am attracted to ) are very ... i've done that whole full time thing for years . sucks man ... i crashed and burned ... i swear i'll never take another full time job in my life . . i think part time jobs helps us nfps get thru the day ... oh . that's hard living with parents ... .. i'm at my child hood home . ( my parents died years ago ) . . its my sister's house now . they are cool . . but still . wisdom teeth are extremely hard to take care of ... otoh , there are times when health problems are emotional . and infps are rife for suppressing emotion . like we are the little jesuses of the world ... i consider myself infp . but i also thought of myself as a strong thinker , logical etc ... so though i'm fi i think i'm ti as well ( definitely ne ) ... but the thing for infp is not that they are logical ... i noticed a lot of immaturity on this site . not from the young members , but from the ones who actually have years of experience with mbti etc ... mbti is about healthy relationships . i think people ... wow . that's heavy . maybe more heavy is how the heck you learned infp . ( i guess like you said , you had to grow up ) . well , however you learned it i'm so glad you did . its so good to know you . ... my ... tear jerkers yeah . . i try not to be sitting where people can see my eyes tear . . but then what to do with the tears dripping down ? ( kinda busted when you bring your sleeve up to wipe the face ) . ... welcome . i hate the tests too . i feel like i get better results looking at the profiles of various functions . i'm older , so i have a lot of behavior to compare with ... though there are many people ... it troubles me that no matter how hard i try to do things right , i have these very old habits that annoy the people i love , employers , etc ( non-infp of course and probably mostly the ts and js ) . it ... find the job you hate the least ( it may take a very long time to get paid for the job you love ) ... part-time if you can afford it . then get a plan to get into a job you like . ... idk . that's the best ... because we deserve it ? ... sorta . welcome , i'm trying to learn the types as well . been trying for a year now ... real fun , but very confusing ... and thru pc i realized i was mixing up my t and j types when observing them ( publicly on ... i think jung would agree . he obviously believed in the types , but when it came to actually observing the individual he was against letting the type generalities bias him ( if that is possible ? ) ... i ... hey welcome ... what part of enfp dont you like ... i was married to a ixtj ( i'm pretty sure but still knew at this ) for years . just separated ... that tj fp clash killed us . if i had known about mbti ... welcome . yeah , that whole honesty thing is overated ... i think i just blew a job interview cuz of it lol ... why are you depressed ? you are always waiting for free time ? ditto . i guess that's a classic infp thing . and when i get free time at home i drink coffee during the day and beer by night . . . we are good at starting ... i wish i had more understanding of disassociation ( psychology mbti etc ) . but i do have a lot of experience in christianity ( not a doctor though ) ... i was into fundamental christianity for ... cool thanks for the differentiation . . i need to expand my library ( and head ) asap . op's gotta be p ... you can call me ignorant . show me otherwise . what do you mean by j vs p doesn't make sense with mbti ? ... i'm not sure if i'm t or f ( cuz i'm on the cusp i guess ) ? would this be another example of something that doesn't make sense ? well , yeah , i'm ignorant . that's why i joined . . i think there are a lot of ignorant people here . and tons of people who aren't - people i envy for all these years of knowledge and experience ... i ... i never had complete ownership of my mind . i was too busy trying to be a serous person ... so true , i spent 30 years trying to be someone i wasnt . now in the wake of all the disaster ( i myself ... well it could be the s / t factor ... but is this about s , t , j and my ignorance ? i think my 1st comment came across very cocky . i in no way wanted to do that . i usually qualify such inflammatory ... i wouldn't know . i never studied personality types by jung :) ... in fact i would have put money down that coy was a j ... but now you agree that he is a s / t ... are you sure that's not j behavior ? ... its a mixed bag . i heard that something like 80 % of arguments aren't even over a real disagreement ... otoh , i think infps 1st reaction is to assume they know ... so yeah , you're right . the best ... duh , sorry , i thought you orinally posted j or p . mybad :) hmmm . . well , its just my opinion based on the information at hand . . questionnaires arent always very helpful . i never even finished one . then again i'm an infp - i never finish projects lol . ... i dont think i'll ever be happy with a job ... after many years in this infp shell , i'm convinced ... its quite depressing . so i just do what i hate the least and try to make life less painful . . in ... i didnt even know this book was out there . shows what i know . i must get ! thanks ! i smell a j lol :) you sound more j than p . . i'm a p and was married to a j ... ( i'd like to think i'm a j expert . but i am still sorta new to mbti . studying it almost 1 year now ) you sound more like an intp ... i'm a infp and i tend to hoard ( especially books . 1000s ! one of several complaints my separated wife had against me and she's a j - sooo not a hoarder ) . ... i dont sense ... as an infp i think i am highly allergic to js ... ( i think ... i'm sorta knew at this ) . . and i dont suspect a hint of j in you ... of course your personal description is a little short ... i think js ... hey welcome derik 1992 . i'm an infp and i think i give my energy when i'm with people ( any people ) . ( i suppose it runs out quicker if there's a conflict etc involved ) . ... but i dont think enfps ... hi ! i've had a very exciting 1st year studying mbti and i wasnt even on this forum ... so i think you will have a real good time for many months to come ... hopefully years . very cool post ... that's why i joined p . c . - and why i'm on infp forum specifically . , i was tired of being destroyed by family , peers , church etc . . ( of course to my shame i hurt a lot of people in ... i just learned about mbti less than a year ago ; but i'd have to say you are a classic infp ... i represent myself differently to the public than to the private as well . . i use to feel chameleon-ish ... you have some good thoughts ... i think we need to be in the philosophy forum [ quote = yippy ; 19933218 ] polarity 22 the answer to your question is : 42 lol . yes yippy . if numbers have anything to do with it , 42 would be a good guess ( re : hitchhikers guide ) . 42 is the ... yeah , picking at dry skin seems wierd . but that's what some animals do .. so i guess that gets at the core of what love really is : hygiene :) i bit a girl once when i was 8 . i've blocked it from ... like shameless nation , nothing else makes sense ... i never even took the test . i tried . but i got annoyed with it or something ( of course i never finish projects ) . ... so i just looked at the ... as an infp i think you could be right by choosing purple . . for years i've leaned towards purple as my favorite color . . ( teal may be my 2nd runner up ) ... mbti and colors ? sorta cabalistic . i like ... i believed those things too . for years . but now i know that this is part of our codependent nature . i think as infps we tend to be the yin side of the codependency ... but now that i understand ... hmmm . . well , ( i'm new at this ) blueflare said hormones dont change types . but you feel your t changed to an f ; and woogiefox said people get their ts and fs crossed . but you also say you're ... yeah , you are up against a lot ... when i was 20 i was at a crossroad ( subconsciously ) . nothing was working for me ( relationships , school , jobs etc etc ) ... long story short : i became a christian , and ... i think tetsuo shima illustrates my observation quite well ( and again it is just an observation based on studies of the top natural endocrinologist in the world - therry hertoghe ) . your drama , ... only thought of it once after a divorce ... in general , i'd say my infp dreams and greener on the other side of the fence philosophy keeps me going ... but it is exhausting .
