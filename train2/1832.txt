! not acceptable ! i would say , when you do x , it hurts my feelings because i asked you not to do it and now i feel like you don't care that you're making me feel bad . i bet you will only have to say this once . also ... also , i cannot abide the thought of being a single mom , and having already been divorced once i am scared shitless of the ( statistically quite likely ) idea of having another marriage fall apart but ... ok , i just wanted to say i came in here expecting to be in the minority but most of you exactly mirror my thoughts in the subject ! i am , at this point in my life ( 29 , which i just had to subtract to ... when my entp bf is drunk he calls me and gets all sappy & mushy . y'all are adorable . my question : do m ( any ) of you relate to being super adverse to something for the principle of it / possibly ... i am extremely loyal to the point of hanging on when i should have cut and run for my own good . the two intjs in my life that decided i wasn't right for them anymore ( my personality was like nails on ... hell yes - like a lot of you guys , i used to think i was an infp . i would have panic attacks and be super hyper focused on what could go wrong in social settings ( this invariably meant , if i said or ... this is so me , and it can be super difficult to explain this to yourself / someone else . i've had people call me out on not being myself , but i genuinely feel like i'm being myself even when i'm ... for me , the test can be misleading on t vs f and sometimes j vs p depending on how i feel that day ( it sometimes even scores me as an i instead of an e , although i've never tested as a sensor , thank ... i'm no expert but i'd study fi vs fe . i don't get fe at all but i get teary when i read people's descriptions of fi . secondly study ti vs te , which was a bit trickier for me to get a handle on but ... i was on okc for years - sadly it's not the norm . that's pure double ne you see there . i met my current bf on there , but he was a 98 % match . i'd be scared of a 47 % match . oh god so true . lol . sounds like a conversation between me & my entp bf . i guarantee you if they didn't know what ne-dom was they went and googled it and now possibly know more about it than you :p we are curious ... i think there are people of every belief that try to force their views on others . i would certainly never try to do that . imho infps are the ultimate hippie . i have three in my family alone . so crunchy omg . i'm an atheist . never had an experience that convinced me otherwise . i have an enormous ... libido . hang ups are a waste of time when you could be having fun sex ! i love when you meet someone super compatible with you and their face just smells so good for no reason and ... so eloquent , man . this is totally why i don't get the crusader mindset . my fi says , believe what you believe and let everyone else do their own thing . so not a recipe for enacting change . i love to collect ( beautiful / strange / interesting ) objects . i don't get super attached to them but i love the newness . i often vaguely feel like i should volunteer or help but i don't . i just ... i am ! it's been a year and a half and we are sickeningly cute and we are totally getting married . he said so . hi ! lemme know if you need anyone else to talk to :) i love to be alone ! but like Ã¡dej said , i am always communicating with text or facebook . i totally feel this . what's so weird for me is how i can think i look terrific one day ( i actually have great self confidence ) and the next wonder how anyone could see me as attractive . i also ... i do not think i have an addictive personality since i can't stick with anything longer than a few months . i've experimented with most things and have really come to dislike drugs , and i drink in ... yes . i love dynamics like this . sooo ... i do this . and it makes me sad . like panzer said , it has to do with my life changing . as i've gotten older i see more patterns and this is one . i get really apathetic sometimes , usually at ... have you tried setting ___ on fire ?
