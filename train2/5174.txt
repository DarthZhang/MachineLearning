' i totally agree with you . mine is earned . and i'm just curious what others think .. i'm trying to figure somethings out .. and i've learned that trusting people is a huge thing with some people . if you ... my trust with people are very thin . i love people and everything , a i repeatedly give them chances and i noticced people take advantage of this . it's really hurting me cause i feel like i keep being ... well , i wouldn't try to pay much attention to him .. just agree with it when he insults you and just be like ya , you're cool but then .. also stick up to him .. tell him straight up he's being low , ... personally ... the quiet people i take almost like a challenge .. and try to figure who they really are .. and their talents and stuff .. cause i did that to one my quieter friends .. i wanted to get to ... ya .. it takes an insanely long time to see what medication works .. and other medication to straighten out the other stuff you are taking .. i hope he finds stuff that works for him . and the bestest ... also .. i hope best for your friend .. i know how scary and helpless you feel to see someone you care about go through that and think that .. do you think it might be the medication he's on ? cause i ... oka thanks for the information :) but i'll give you some heads up .. my sister has had a manic episode .. many .. when we were younger and before she went to hospitals , treatment centers , then a place ... hmm .. oka :) but really .. who isn't under stress ? but that might be true .. just i've been through way more stressful things then what is going on now .. and i usually take it extremely good ! i know they will :) things dont stay sucky forever ... :) just gotta stay positive .. last night she was just in the er ... and her ex boyfriend broke in the house ... our neighbors caught him and ... that is a great thought .. but my mom can barely keep the house and food on the table .. we just got her insurance .. and she has seen a therapist and stuff before .. but now that she is out of ... oh ! and sometimes .. some people consider me awkward because i'm so bubbley . does that happen with you ? i can just tell they are like ... whoa .. haha ! for parties .. i like it when people are being active .. and partying it up ! ! ! i'm usually the one trying to start games .. or rocking out to music .. i try to talk to everyone .. and ya .. i usually try ... oka ! :) i could maybe make the cookies at my dads , sense mom is low on the cash hahah ! but that's a good idea ! :) : laughing : ya , i guess is the only thing i can do is try to be understanding and supporting .. and wait it out . hey ! i am an enfj .. and i wanna know how to help my sister that is 19 with the mental disorder of we think bipolar .. but lately we aren't sure . but she's off her medication and is pregent .. and i ... i'm going to see what the advice place says .. hey amazing enfj's ! ! i'm just curious .. what do you guys do to make you feel better or for happiness ? ? ? cause i'm trying to find new ways to make myself feel .. important . : mellow : ha ya .. i'm trying really hard to stay .. happy . :) it isn't that hard .. plus i have soccer tonight , so this should make me feel better with excirsising ... and talking with people . i mean yesterday ... truthfully .. i don't think i've done that before .. surprisingly ! xd hahah i dont think you are insane or crazy .. just maybe you are zoned out ? :) at less they are like me .. i hate when people touch me when i'm crying .. so listening is the best bet .. and like everyone said ... comforting words .. just be there . let your instincts on what to do ... all i can say is thank you so much ... and ha .. i feel for ya curitaderana .. the scary times are tough .. but when i look back .. there are some pretty funny times :) and i'm a big laugh it off , shrug it ... i know i'm huge on organization .. like .. when the house is a mess .. i never really know waht to do with other peoples stuff .. but i try to just make it look nice .. i make it look neat .. and while i'm ... thanks .. this helps alot .. and really .. what is taring me .. and i really don't wanna sounds like a person that has issues alot .. and everything .. andi don't wanna be a burden .. i don't wanna ... i bet everyone goes through that i'm perrrty sure ? :) hehe the goal thing is a great idea .. and truthfully .. i don't have much of an idea on the in and stuff :) thanks so much ! that helpedd alot , nice to know someone kinda gets what to say or how to give advice :) : laughing : i mean they are so unloveable .. they don't want to cooperate and let you go ! ! they wanna keep you forever hehe hahah ! well you can think .. easily .. and think swamps are evil .. while i try to think of them aas something beautiful and add habitate to the world xd : laughing : swamps are too outgoing ? ! ? ! they invite all the insects , frogs , turtles , snakes , and other nature things to let them live with them ! ! how isn't that outgoing ? ! ? ! :D :D :D drawing isn't only art .. you could be good at painting .. sculptures .. making up dances .. cooking .. writing .. poetry .. personally i'm werid and i like to call many things art .. anything created ... hahaha ! always nice to have backups :) and don't worry .. i'm sure it's just a time .. just don't doubt yourself ! ! :) hehe .. alrighty .. i was going through an emotional time and i was kinda like ... i need to stop being so down .. so i started to think of random things .. and tell me why you think they need that hehe ... well .. he's super understanding .. and caring .. if i bring it up to him .. i know he'll try or want to fix it right away .. and probably doesn't even know it's bothering mee .. haha .. i just hate to hurt ... well .. it's mainly over phone , chat , and txt he's like that .. not in person .. we both live in different towns .. and i think communication is a huge thing in a relationship .. so is it cause he doesn't ... that's exactly it ! i feel so down .. i hate being downers for others .. and it really eats at me .. when i know someone cant help me .. or i don't know how to allow them .. and i know it feels horrible ... : laughing : that's greatt ! and i bet that made you feel wonderful ! ! i'm proud :) truthfully .. i really don't fully understand the ni yet .. because i just started this .. but .. i think with your assuming .. you are jumping to conclusions ? i do this all the time .. maybe even ... for your mom .. even though this is really not your responsibility .. but if it'll make you feel better , go for it . but for you mom ... seems like she has a hard time trying to love herself .. point out ... i agree . you have to go through gut feeling .. and who has told the truth more in the past .. ya i know you are right .. and it's a horrible habit .. but it's the only way i can take things one step at a time kinda deal .. but oka .. lets say .. i have asked him why he isn't talkative .. and he ... what do you mean by shadow behavior ? and that's pretty much it .. just it's getting too me .. i think i'll be oka .. :) thanks ! the problem is .. i feel like i'm being blocked out from others .. otherwise i usually surround myself with tons of people .. could we have a toothpaste tower ? ! xd oka .. everytime i hit an object i say sorry too it .. like if i run into the wall .. i willsay sorry to it .. hmm .. when i get really happy i have this need to like scream and just be like wooohhh ! ... i'm an enfj and i dont think it's reading .. i observ .. and i understand why people do things and where they are coming from .. more then anything . i'm good at knowing why someone does something ... ya ... so i'm like .. if you are busy .. we can talk later ? then he's like no no no ! and then barely says anything ? but then some days he actually tries to add to the conversation .. and i'm sure he ... when i meet new people .. i tend to be crazyy and woooh ! to see how they react to me and actually try to make an effort to be my friend .. also .. i observe the person .. their actions , what they say and ... yes ! this literally does drive me crazyy too .. like with my friends or something .. if i'm going somewhere and i know i wont even have my phone for example with me .. i will tell them before hand so i ... it does help me undersstandd ... thanks :) but i mean .. by emotionally .. is i don't like burdening people with my problems .. and i know he just wants to help ... but i too .. like to suffer alone ... truthfully .. i have the exact same problem .. but i understand their actions more .. considering i need friends .. they say they will be there for me but really .. best advice i can give ... is hint ...
