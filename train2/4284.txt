you're making me want to bang my head against the wall . intjs are not players . just because someone does not immediately respond to you does ... no offense at all ; this is totally true . it's a double standard . while intj males can encounter problems with being labeled this way or being perceived as arrogant , i've found that it's not as ... people always think i hate them , i'm angry , i'm upset , or i'm bored . i don't get it--it's just my face . you sound like an infp with enfp leanings . your i is probably pretty weak , which isn't a bad thing as that means your functions are well balanced . enfps can be really cool people as long as they're ... sorry double post . 80 % is pretty good . no one's going to fit their profile 100 % . yeah the j trait is really unfortunately named . there is a correlation between being really organized and judgmental / spontaneous and open-minded , but they're not mutually exclusive . you'd probably be ... in a nutshell , j / p is about how organized you are . do you plan every second of your day or do you enjoy spontaneity ?

that could be the issue . is he constantly criticizing you ? also a problem . i tend to be objective about my flaws and actively work on overcoming them , but i wasn't ... i think what you said was normal--i would actually be very flattered , and have been in the past , when people have said similar things to me . i think it's because so many people think i'm weird or ... this . if there isn't a question explicitly asked in the message , i assume no response is necessary . if you push him too much , he's going to run like wildfire . intjs really need to feel independent in their decisions . and as it's only been two days , it's really not a big deal . again , just because we ... which do you think your dominant function is ? would fi be in your top two ? if this is the case , you probably aren't a t . i just looked back at the function chart ; infp was in the corner and i ... i tend to stop contact with people for multiple days at a time , especially during the week . a while ago i found out that some of my friends thought something terrible had happened to me because i ... take the 16personalities.com test . that's the best one i've found , which isn't saying much . the point of testing is to point you in a possible direction , then you do your own research and figure out ... all except coldplay . good choices ( especially the shins ) . guardian : istj , maybe estj . probably wouldn't work out as i deplore tradition / hierarchical duty and prefer to question everything . artisan : istp . i could definitely see this working out with a lot ... i don't even know what to do with this . i've concluded that you must be a trolling entp , in which case this is hilarious and kind of impressive . if not , well , good luck buddy . you'll need it . i'd say both--i don't buy that they're mutually exclusive . people tend to view me as cynical and pragmatic to the point of a fault , but in reality i'm quite idealistic and optimistic , just with a ... you clearly have no idea what introversion , or anything else in psychology , is . i can't even read past this point . the fact that you are taking all criticism so personally means you will never be an ... the function stack is a way of bringing order to that chaos . people that think mbti and the functions place people in neat little boxes don't have a proper understanding of either theory . as far as ... i tend to find cognitive function-only tests to be inaccurate as they don't use the function stack . for that you need to pair it with mbti . for example , you can't have two introverted or extraverted ... yeah , unfortunately it's all a continuum so some people are stuck between categories . this isn't inherently bad though , as it probably means you're more balanced in some ways . as for the functions , ...
