' i also agree with esfj . e f f p esfp seems like a perfect fit . socionics infp correlates with mbtt infp most of the time , assuming one doesn't critically consider the function split between the two ; i don't know what your mbtt type is but it's probably that . i ... isfj in socionics , so most likely isfj in mbtt you're reliable and hardworking ; this immediately eliminates all p types . you're concerned for stability and freedom ; this pits you in the ij ... yes , that's definitely fe / ni she's expressing ; all those emotions getting out , the powerful imagination aiding her cognition . however , if she's an intuitive introvert , she will , more times than not , ... yes , i saw it ; i was leaning toward intp at first , but i had to think for a while as to where his intuition was oriented . i'm honestly not very certain of his type ; he uses both ni and ne very ... another read over and i came to this conclusion : infj the answer as to why i was getting vibes from both isfp and isfj are clear to me now : you are actually using the perceiving functions of one , ... i think infj is correct . that's why i said intp ; the op is an ili , so there should be some very thick te present all over ( doesn't matter which te since they're fundamentally the same thing in each system . ) if she were an ... isfp would be more likely ; you're much too down-to-earth to be an infp . infps are big world-builders , often lost in their fantasies of what could be , exploring mirrors of reality in a sense , whereas ... entj entj yes , this is what i mean ; logical types don't prefer to use persuasion , it's a last resort sort of thing ; the reverse is true for ethical types . this is why i'm saying you're a logical type ; ... this would be an example of persuasion . i'm not saying ethical types can't do it , i'm saying they prefer not to , like you just showed me . intp also , i did read your questionnaire ; you do sound like an intj ( in the very least , you are certainly in the ij temperament , as you are a very static individual ) , which would explain why your fe / ti ... i see where you're coming from but i must remind you that many logical types mistype as infj ( i was one of them for a few months , myself . ) so my apologies for skewing the image of the infj but i ... i will type you via socionics first : you are a dynamic ni-ego individual : this means you're either an intp , infp , entj , or enfj . this fits with the following : intj infjs simply don't have the same drive you do for proving yourself right and seeking the truth ; as a rule , ethical types prefer to use persuasion , not argumentation ; ethical types prove you ... both the intp and infp have a fundamental desire to have their beliefs sorted out , and to have those beliefs come into fruition ( something they're bad at doing because they're rather lazy , and so ... the amount of entjs on this forum is about the amount of any given sj type , iirc , so there's not nearly as many to begin with . with that aside , considering we have te in the ego , we're mostly here ... when you interact with the external world ( objects ) , you're an extrovert , and when you interact with your personal sentiments ( subjects ) , you're an introvert ; everyone does both , so the question is , ... i'd say infp , considering you like to take care of people so tenderly ; ni is actually very strong in this personality type ( 2nd most powerful ) , though you wouldn't know it from the ordering . it's ... my analysis indicates enfp ; when you talk about not wanting to miss opportunities , i knew you had to be some sort of np . you want to be knowledgeable , indicating te somewhere in the mix . thing with ... 1 . poor fe albeit awareness of it , ni in top functions , so either intj or entj 2 . perceiving-dominant , ergo nite i could give an analysis of the whole thing but if it's just the type you're ... definitely ne / si ; you're also a rational type in that you stop to weigh all your decisions as opposed to just going with the flow , which leaves us with either inxp or esxj . you don't seem to value ... you strike me as more of an isfp , esp . when you talk about caring greatly for aesthetics which has more to do with the sensory functions . isfj is my vote , infj as another possibility . i think isfj is a stronger option because you have more of a tenacity to go out and do the things you want changed ( s ) , as opposed to trying to ... istp 100 % entp , so probably an entp in mbtt as well . here's my scratch pad so you can see how i came to this conclusion : hey nichya , thanks for the question . functionally , infps and infjs do convert evenly , but the functions are defined in different ways in each system so the conversion is largely pointless . ... iei ( nife ) , so infx in mbtt . you'll find most type as infp , whereas most eiis ( fine ) type as infjs . it's just one of those situations where the functions don't correlate properly ; this is due to ... you're a socionics lse , which roughly translates into estj . here's how that works : first , you admit that you favor intelligence and believe that knowledge is power ; you hate to be wrong about ... ne works with the object , ni works with the subject . example : ne : i wonder what these objects mean . ni : i wonder what a gelatin elephant would look like . ne would then proceed to conjure ... enfp i do see your strongest function as ne , however , you are devaluing fe in these places : either estj or entj . ni-dominant is unlikely as you're not expressing a strong desire to pursue the unknowable ( e . g . what would happen if the dinosaurs never went extinct ? ); rather , you're a ... xnxp si , ergo xnxp judging > perceiving intp seems more likely , but i'd buy infp as well . both types share the same disdain for people trying to make them do stuff . fe-valuing , se-valuing and yearning , which leaves enfj or infj . consider both , but don't consider enfp . these types are nothing if not stereotypical ; point is , they're proactive , whereas intjs are receptive . the intj is in perpetual idle state until his energy is worthy of the task at hand , whereas ... descriptions for the istp are pretty botched for various reasons ( mostly because of kiersey's disregard for the functions imo ) , but i strongly believe you're an istp . for some reason , istj and istp ... an ij will tell you when you're wrong , but he won't tell you what to think . what you think is a quality of introversion , extroverted functions can't touch them , and an intj really doesn't have a ... giant red flag that you're an ixtp . ixtj is really out of the question now ! 100 % positive you're an ixxp type . istp seems most likely to me . intj you acknowledge that mixing emotions with the outer world is a bad plan of action , which shows a concern for te and disregard for fe ; you then go on to say that people should think for ... isfp my father is exactly the same way . if you actively seek to command , you're an entj . if you want to live an enjoyable life , you're an intj . ejs are natural leaders , ijs are natural individualists ;
