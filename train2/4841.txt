not by telling me i have other good qualities ... not by saying he appreciates me intellectually . nope .  ... i'm so grateful for you ... you don't even know . you write out exactly what i'm feeling . what you said about calling yourself an asshole , and simultaneously smiling at it , and feeling gross about it , ... at this point , my reason for existing is twofold : beauty and art . literally nothing else matters to me . i want to create art . and to be art . uhh ... i think you're forgetting someone there , frienderino . 716921 do people ever become famous / appreciated for their drawings ? i feel as though it's always for painting ... but i enjoy drawing / sketching infinitely more than painting ... painting is so much more ... thank you . :) although to be honest , i don't even feel disgust over having these particular traits ... i've just realized that everything i value in life and want for myself is very physically focused ... is it weird that i somehow knew you were blonde ?
