okay , guys . she came here to get typed , no not to go through three pages of notes on cheese , deceptive as the title may be . sometimes but mostly not at all . they can be useful for getting a vantage point , but often studying the functions will give you a better , more accurate result . understood . sorry if i came off as aggressive . you know you are an intj when people assume that you are an unfeeling robot when really you are just smart enough to not show your feelings . if anonymous is considered quotable . i find it silly how you call me out on this when so many others have done the same in a smaller size of text . so sadly , no , that is not my personal wit and theory ... eh ... i doubt nukes would be the best bet . with so much of earth destroyed , there'd be no world to take over . i think the best way is to change the world-become popular . when you are popular or a ... i think intj is popular as an antagonist type because of the cruel ideal society has placed on everyone . lots with the ' extrovert ideal ' , which is why many childhood heroes and heroines tend to be ... depressed genius who invents the cure to cancer and thus makes everyone else optimistic while still finding some way to be depressed . yup . i love science , advanced english , and most of geometry / math . i wouldn't say that-just because there aren't as many of us as , say , esfp , that doesn't mean that people won't understand us . i understand other types-i'm not limited to just my own type , nor are the ... 9 things i hate about everyone 1 . people who point at their wrist while asking for the time ... i know where my watch is pal , where the hell is yours ?
