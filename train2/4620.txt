having plans .. and other priorities in life is attractive .. but im not really sure i understand the desire to play the game .. to me . this just ... i feel like pulling a mr rodgers .. i like you just the way you are .. one in 7 billion your hardly the first person to ask this question .. mbti offers a kind of framework for understanding yourself and others .. something theoretically that enfj's probably could appreciate .. i think ... projecting my voice back in time .. im doing great almost one year ago hmm well i have found that people have various levels of emotional need regarding feeling like they are undestood / validated by others .. a person who is mostly unconscious of their own need for ... also noticed that etherea is now posting as an enfp .. etherea now that i have your attention : tongue : im rather curious to know if there is thread regarding this decision ... lets see . i joined .. ranted .. felt better .. left .. ranted .. felt better , left .. so given this history ide say that i joined personality cafe so that i can act out an abusive codependency which can go ... ok so looking over the history it appears i have been mia for about .. 4 months or so .. and since it does feel rather much like barging into an old friends house without first calling to say hello .. i ... im certainly not here to dissuade you from finding a better way to communicate your boundaries regarding emotional disclosure . honestly , although i would feel somewhat rejected , stating simply that ... i think its important that although we are playing with a system of differentiation , to remember fundamentally that peoples needs are very similar , physical , social , emotional , mental . making social ... so your fundamentally unhappy that people who are not like you exist .. sorry no way to solve this .. honest and true criticisms are not alone enough or reason at all really .. to cause a person ... i usually avoid threads like this since generally they are written by people trying to justify and use mbti to rationalize their personally negative stereotypes , see critical ... however in another ... what ? i give light , friendly , supportive , full on , remorseful , loving and distant hugs , every day .. all depending on what the situation calls for .. im not sure how trying to define the distinction in ... the most precious thing any one person has is the time left remaining in their lives , i have a whole system where i try balance driving efficiently and safely out of consideration for not negatively ... not an intj .. fellow f dom here , girl honestly people oonly really learn from experiences , and its great that your willing to consider reconciliation , and i'm not trying to undercut that but , what ... lol , while its definitely a fact that it often easier for me to to communicate with women in general .. and i have some number as good friends .. i wouldn't describe there loyalty to me as being part ... should i take it your trying to provoke a response ?
