' well , i finally made it , i finally know for sure ( 100 % sure ) my tritype ( 4w3 , 6w7 and 9w8 ) , if you guys want an accurate result then be honest , answer it all and dont be drunk lol , it s tough to be sensitive ... weird , aloofish , doubtful and other stuff . hmmm ... i think bonnie is an enfj i have thought about it a while ago ( not in depth , so correct me if i am wrong ): naruto : either a 6w7 or 3w2 , sasuke : 3w4 , shikamaru : 9w1 , madara : 3w4 , raikage :8 w7 and minato : either 1w9 or 5w6 . for me the most attractive types are 9w1 ( the peacefulness ) , 8w7 ( hot and sort of gentle ) , 2w3 ( beauty and impulsiveness ) , 3w4 ( beauty , hot and kind of fun ) and 4w5 ( deepness and beauty ) . my tritype : 6w7 , 1w9 and ... it is nice to have a healthy type on my tritype for a change lol thank god i realized that things are perfect the way they are . guys i m sorry for coming here again but i must correct my tritype which most certainly is : 6w7 , 1w9 and 4w5 , and not 9w1 in the gut center after all trust me i have done a variety of things to be sure ... i finally discovered for sure my tritype : 6w7 , 9w1 and 4w5 ( in that exact order ) maybe there is some chance to these types create a relationship let me see , both have a certain compliance , competency and independency so maybe it could work ( 6w7 , 9w1 , 4w5 ) . that is ridiculous , 7s also have anxiety , it is just less apparent . i actually do not believe in any of these dimensions but maybe there are similar places hahaha ( 6w7 , 4w5 and 9w1 ) . heaven : 2w1 , 6w7 , 5w4 , 9w1 , 9w8 , 4w5 , 7w6 , 1w9purgatory : 6w5 , 1w2 , 5w6 , 8w9 , 3w2 , 4w3 and hell : 3w4 , 2w3 , 7w8 and 8w7 . i suppose that good matches for like all types would be : 9 and 7,1 and 3,2 and 7,3 and 1,4 and 6,5 and 1,6 and 4,7 and 9 and 8 and 4 ( it is harder to find types that comine well with twos , fives and ... it is also necessary to analyze the tritype of the couple , a 295 for example would understand a lot more about a 5 just as a 521 would understand a lot more about a 2 , so you gotta check the other two ... tritype theory is closer to the complexity of human beings therefore i agree with it , a person think that only one thing marked her life ... lame if you ask me but each one with your own opinion , oh ... it is something that i created , really but not entirely , i was researching myself ( as always , seeker thing i believe ) and i was curious about this shadow type stuff that i kept reading on the enneagram ... 648 it is , do you know your wings though ? i think i have seen once or twice that you are a 6w7 , am i right ? what about your other wings ? ( my tritype : 6w7 , 9w1 and 4w5 and shadow tritype : 2w1 , 5w4 and 9w8 ) . it is hard to put a general look of who we are in here and being a seeker makes it even harder because i always have doubts about myself . 6w7 , 9w1 and 4w5 , usually gentle unless i am in a type three mode or stessed of another way but never passive like 692 , i look for what is missing , for my identity not for love like a type 2 fix , my inner ... i have read once that arya is a 9w1 and i see that on her , maybe a sx 9w1 but still a dreamer on the other hand i also read here on this thread that she is a 6w7 and she seems to have the traits of ... 9w1 to be exact , the people of canada do not seem to have that expansive energy of 9w8 on the other hand they have the intellectual rigor of 1 energy ( 6w7 , 9w1 , 4w5 ) . correction : ... because they have the ability to zone out and keep going . what i meant is that they can do irritating stuff without getting stressed because they have the to zone out and keep going . yep , nines deal with situations that others would find very frustrating to take action , that is because they value the harmonic work which means that they value work as everyone else since it does not ... i think that type 4s with a type 1 in their instinctive center do not lack so much self-confidence , now in terms of wing 4w5s have more concrete ideals and 4w3s usually do not have so many ideals ... according to some enneagram sources emptiness is the shadow of fives therefore it is what they avoid the most as you have said and it is exactly that shadow that must be integrated into the ... i think the ideal would be doing the test and self-observation . my tritype :( 6w7 , 9w1 , 4w5 ) , maybe you could give a chance to me , lol . i am sorry but a 2 for a 6 is not the best deal , sixes eventually feel that they need to get busy with their thoughts and a 2 would almost never let them dive into their inner world trying to help ... i definitely think it is an useful part of the enneagram theory , i mean i can not resist one day without drinking something , laughing , well in other words , distracting myself.according to some ... it is complicated to talk about this , i mean i have no doubt that one of the two numbers will always dominate but the wing adds a lot of traits to a person especially if it is a heavy wing , some say ... hi , i just became a member of personality cafe and i was already told to introduce myself so ... i am hz light , my enneagram type is 6w7 and my tritype is 6w7 , 9w1 and 4w5 , i still have to find my mbti ...
