it's all based on judgments . and yes it's all semantics and it's all ... no the way we perceive people is automatically a judgment . judging people doesn't mean you don't give them a chance . it means you're bringing a certain lens into how you view the world and the people ... i don't think we're more kind than intps . in fact , i would imagine entps way more prone to engage in conflict with people though i don't think that makes entp's unkind . entps get away with saying ... it's important to be judgmental or discriminatory or else you'll waste your time with morons . yeah high school is lame . it gets better . no reason to rush through college . take your time , learn , be irresponsible , be an idiot , learn from that , get a little better in your decision-making , ... i don't party much anymore . in my party days , i was always the last man standing , though , and i could drink anyone under the table . i was never a sloppy drunk though . i just get super extroverted and ... both . i'm both . i get along with most types pretty easily though istjs can grate on me which isn't to say i don't enjoy their company . my istj friend asked me to be in his wedding . he's been a great friend . two ... what you think you're going to be now will be way different when you graduate . you're not supposed to know . just enjoy the experience of it , whichever college you choose , and take different classes ... my sense of humor is appreciated by most people i come across . you aren't funny if other people aren't laughing or getting what you're saying . our talents lie in presentation . how we present ideas or ... i've always seen myself retiring as a professor in the twilight of my years . i think we would probably be good at a socratic method teaching style which forces people to be able to formulate as ... my inner voice is james earl jones . if james earl jones is an infj boy then that just happens to be highly coincidental . i bet you masturbate while winking at yourself in the mirror . organization primarily . i've been running my firm for about 8-9 months . i'm operating at a profit and see good things coming ; however , it's important to find people to compensate in areas you ... being a great person is not about getting the better of people ; it's about getting the best of people . use your talents to motivate and inspire . being right about something and not knowing when to ... i'm much better at one to one conversations . i don't think it's that i'm much better actually . i'm good in group dynamics as long as i am enjoying the energy of the group ; however , i prefer one to ... you tell them you rebel you yeah right . you're such a serious online flirt . you love it . you're welcome . i want to know your opinion on conversations about having conversations . jesus christ . clearly i don't consider italian americans white and obviously only animals live in new jersey . you have kids ?
