you know i've never dated and istp , may not even know one actually . but i have dated an istj and an estp . i'm the opposite of some of you , i tell my boyfriend to listen to the song ' more than words ' ... personally i have grown very fond of any and all intjs , my best friend is one , along with two other male friends ... one i am considering dating . i find their criticism and orderliness very helpful ... pretending to do some schoolwork , listening to music and thinking it's about time to eat . gtbean , i can very much agree with everything you said . i would have to say that both of us were very attached at the time and in living together and not being able to be around other people we ... i completely agree with pilgrim , we women like a guy who can relate and the feeling side of you does that . xd you know my mother , she is an infp dear . yeah , i dated another enfp once .. bad bad idea ! hahaha . yeah , yeah we do ... haha . i can agree with that , best of luck to you my friend . i feel the same about my estp that i am so obsessed with ... but i'm beginning to thing i need to look more for and ntp ... he isn't coming back ... yeah , they do that ... my nickname for my twin is ' egotistical asshole ' when he's upset over something ... it's quite a way to wear an enfp down if you ask me . i'm sorry you're having to deal with that , i know it's a fairly painful experience ... i'm not going through that , but something similarly painful . i've never really understood my intp friends ' ... i completely agree , i had a boyfriend once that liked to say i promise about some of the smallest and simplest things and yet didn't understand why when he broke it i was upset . what it is about ... welcome my introverted friend . =) i would have to say that i have been prone to addiction , all it takes is one time and then i'm so hungry to do it again that i keep it up and tend to not consider stopping for several years at a ... i would say that my main thing would be people that don't take time to truly get to know me and understand me , which yes does require trying to see things from my point of view . i think it's just an enfp quality really ... i've always been that way and from time to time it lands me into some serious trouble . xp love it . i'm sixteen ans that's totally me without my mountain dew . i always have some amount of confidence , if not because the people around me encourage me then it is because i want to prove them wrong . i am a very competitive person by nature . boredom , dance to ... eclectic , extroverted , amusing , creative and intelligent . i have many siblings but only one still lives in the home , my twin brother who is an intp , he and i are the youngest . welcome , it's nice to have you . =) haha , welcome , always nice to see a fellow enfp . =) no , he moves from friend's house to friend's house , now that his car has broken down anyways . he did live with me and when i moved he could no longer live with me and moved into his car . you are correct in assuming he is a bit of a loner , he is never in one place for very long , claiming he is off and about adventuring to ... ' find himself ' and until then he is naught but his own . i agree hotpocket . i'd have to say the reason i don't have anyone in town is because of my attachment to one particular guy , though we are not together until someone just as if not more suitable for me i have no ... i personally cannot speak very well of my own coping mechanisms , as i have been trying to get over the same guy for oh , three and a half months . my problem is i don't want o be over him , i simply ... yes , i must agree ... truly brave . if you want us to talk , sure we'll talk , on and on and on ... haha . i personally find it to be quite joyous as we are much more outspoken and individualistic then ... i agree , my fan base is possibly what keeps me writing . =) friends are really good for that but make sure they are also willing to critisize it , you can't get better if you don't know what's wrong ... indeed we shall , slowly but surely . xd i write whenever i feel like it , but i always feel like writing it seems . yeah , of course i mentioned you . =) you're ten times cooler than zavier . xp i remember when i hugged you once and you froze up , your eyes got really weird and you stared at me . i also remember last night after a round of halo i went to give you a first bump and you stared at ... finessebrawler , i am quite amazed by what you said , not because you had such an experience but because you said it . like i have said before my experience with the male enfps of the world have not ... moby i can actually agree with you . enfps seem like we could be great friends / friends with benifits but not much more than that . oh i often write stories for my mother's newspaper but then i write a lot of poetry and i dabble in other fictional things ... currently , i am writing a book . i rarely have a male in tow unless perhaps it is an old friend , a brother and a brother's friend . or of course an actual boyfriend , i'm not much for extras hanging about . somehow i see my path as quite similar . xp it took a lot of time before it became a release for me ... that and a lot of extrmemly long journal entries ranting and raving . yes , i am a writer ... it is all i can think to do . =) hah , yeah the one i broke up with cried for an hour and i have a flirting problem too , whoops ! oh well , he's still a friend ... who i text maybe once a week and hang out with maybe once a month . i ... i'm a writer , or at least i say that i am . but i have grown up with a mother who is in the newspaper buisness . i like writing poetry but my best poetry comes when i am not attempting to think of ... i forgot one , darn me . cloud from final fantasy : advent children ! very needy , in fact ridiculously so ... i finally slapped him and told him to back up and grow some balls ... which isn't like me to do .. not really . ;P haha , nice , yeah when i told my ex-enfp ... okay , so i'm not much for movies but i've got to agree with some of these ... doc holiday from tombstone , he's just epic , i watched that years ago and still quote it . clint eastwood is almost ... yeah my name is awful in my opinion . virginia , but i go by gin , and raine is my middle name . =) * cough * ... * cough * okay yeah i can't do it either . - . - but yours is nice . xp welcome ! =) always nice to see another enfj , i have a couple of you as friends . =) well , i hang around several types but the majority are intp or intjs , there's an entj an estp .. welcome , it's great to see another enfp . =) i agree very much . it would also explain why i tend to spend more time with intps and intjs than other personality types .
