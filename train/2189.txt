' lol . i already mentioned that i used to share music with her and she didn't like it . not sure why there's this repetition that i should continue to put something that means a lot to me out there only ... i asked for space and she's still messaging me lol ... haha its not not a relationship just yet . we are in the feel out stay but i've been 100 % with her about my thoughts and feelings ... im not married anymore . i also really aproecitiate the in depth analysis as it is relevant unlike whatever drivel i was forced to read in the first posts . she also doesn't understand why i don't like ... your reading comprehension skills need to be up to date , clearly because you aren't discussing anything that i am . the advice you think you were giving isn't advice at all , but merely remnants of ... ... did you read anything i wrote ... or ? you sound like the enfp i am talking about . i make explicit comments and for some reason that still doesn't matter and gets overlooked . she she doesn't ... i didn't pass a quick judgement . my decision was made on common sense and her explicitly voicing to me that she doesn't listen to my type of music , wouldn't go out of her way to listen to it .. unless ... wow . to make things short . i am quickly becoming disinterested and realizing that this might be a huge mistake . i'm talking to an enfp girl most of the time we seem to get along fine . however i ... ok . every type does this though . fair enough . but you are creating your own frustration . it is illogical for you to have intelligible conversations with someone that is under the influence and think the other party is receptive to ... don't ignore a narcissist or you will pay . what you need to do is change your number , address and probably state line . when you're hooking up with a girl and she won't leave after . you guess ? i am feeding you valid information .. not every person that smokes weed becomes fundamentally useless .. i know a lot of people that are managers , very successful in their financial , ... you had better keep away from toothpaste too ! it doesn't trigger you to become schizophrenic . that myth has been debunked . chances are cannabis users that become schizophrenic were already ... you have a myriad of places to decide to smoke up at where you will not get harassed or face legal consequences . it requires planning , imagination , common sense and foresight . [ / color ] you should probably keep clicking your shoes together while you're at it , with that comment . you mean you prefer to not be around lifeless potheads ? don't group every pothead under the same umbrella . because an individual will react differently . ... why have you not ? you can't control your thoughts . you are in control of yourself , when you are high on marijuana . it's just at an altered level due to a heightened sense of self . why don't you smoke frequently ? he got sick from smoking 4 grams of weed ? he clearly wasn't doing things right . impossible . i love you ... sexually ? i love you ... emotionally ? i love you .. uh mentally ? what else would love be in context to .. other than romantically ? no , you shouldn't see a shrink . your grammar is a lot more concerning . here , i'll book you in with the grammar specialist . what is baffling about a child wanting to know how their parents are ... you can start with your room . no one because they probably won't resemble my favourite thing in the world - groceries . in where they will sit in the back , in a bag . can't see any ! chances are it isn't just you . you answered your own question wow , what a waste of green . uh , drugs illegal or not doesn't magically turn otherwise productive people lazy . you were lazy before trying drugs . stop spreading fallacious nonsense about something you've probably never done ... i smoke weed , pretty much every day . i drink rarely . well if you continue to make fallacious claims like intj's not liking you , than say hello to your self-fulfilling prophecy . curious to know if other intj's burn one ? i often have humans , okay no need to reassure everyone here of your fierce robotic stance . we know you're an intj . people think i'm angry most of the time . i don't care to be quite honest . pro-choice . extreme pro-lifers need to keep their mouths shut . conversation with most people . most people i interact with , i don't care for . it's really hard to pretend to care about what someone is saying , when you don't care about them . need . often by being passive aggressive with the silent treatment . not actually dealing with the issue or the person . except they show it in a morally self-righteous way . this can be said about any male . the reason you can't get any dates , may be because of you're inflated sense of self that doesn't exactly corroborate with reality . perhaps ? no . never been to jail . i know two people that have done time in jail . my uncle who murdered someone , and my cousin for drug possession . i have easily broken the law before . simple because it ... genealogy . yes , i am a bossy person . and controlling . get a real job , and you won't have to deal with temp agencies . what general signs are there ? because you could be seeing things and interpreting them entirely different than reality . okay , so what are you looking for than ? i pride myself in my excellent taste in coffee and tea . so i can't say that starbucks is on my list of go-to places . i'm a picky eater . well according to some women , there are various definitions of stalking . so which one are you referring to ? what you feel is completely irrational , but understandable . the more you become accustom to people that validate that you are loveable and worthwhile the more better you may feel . but essentially it ... it seems to me that a lot of intjs on this site are frauds and over compensating . in real life depending on the company , i am by what others say friendly i am only this way because i logically ... you can . but most people won't . that is why beliefs exist in the first person . you don't have a belief if there is no emotional fixation .
