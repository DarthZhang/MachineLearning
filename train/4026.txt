( the second one i used the second part of my last name included , that though i usually never use or anyone use is on the birth certificate . ) ... scaring the shit out of people without the intention yeah , eyebrows no . i don't know how doing nothing can scare people , yes it's a death stare but i'm relatively harmless and there's nothing really ... on the inside yeah super craved as a want not as a need , on the outside most people think i don't even know what sex is . i'd like to do it with someone i like , but the second the thought of a ... never knew one , as far as i know . stereotypically i'd think they'd be the purest form of innocence , reality guessing i'd think they be really nice but kind of overly empathic towards everything . i do like to wear them a lot on just so people don't see my face to clearly and try come up because they know me for a random conversation or when i just got a haircut . if i get a haircut my hoodie ... hispanics tend to have high sex drives ? well that explains a lot , not that i do anything about it . at least not with someone else , i'd like to know why i don't pursue others but that's something i'll ... when people say i'm too serious because of a face that's just natural to me makes no sense . even if i didn't laugh loudly or smile every fricken time someone's around doesn't make me serious , it ... to turn invisible whenever i want and while i'm invisible i can go through anything as if it wasn't there . so during the winter time istps turn into nts because of the climate change and its harder to get se in , and cause there is so much writing and thoughts here its looks a little like abstract thoughts ... wait , he agreed with something i said ? i thought my sarcasm was kinda going against him , oh well i'm just loving this fireworks show . : laughing : extroverts tend to say stuff without thinking it through , which of course could never be bad , just running around with a blindfold on and earplugs in , yelling everywhere . ( not really but you get the ... thinking silently . how am i gonna do this ? that might work , that makes more sense . that's perfect ( to me ) . done ( probably ) . 1 . its not studying if it's an interest , so i'm not studying , i'm just reading it . might go back a few times to remember something . 2 . i don't , procrastination will go to max level and wing whatever ... 1 . i fight back to urge to grin or burst out laughing and leave 2 . fight the urge to do horribly unnecessary pain to them and leave quietly . ( and fight the voice in my head saying ' go back and ... i tend to laugh off the most threats or people's anger too , i think it's because they try to show how angry and pissed they are with a bunch of traits you see on tv or anime . if you have to show me ... how do you react to threats to you or intimidation . compare from when you were a little kid to now . as a kid if i was sensing any hostility i instantly attacked , i was really simple minded , i saw a ... i like taking walks too , mostly at night though , grab a soda at a random store , sit down a bit and walk back home . though i lose a lot of mental energy at school because of all the extroverted stuff ... estj i do want i want to period . i rarely ever give out my number to anyone , people tend to give me theirs and ask for mine and i usually wont give mine cause i don't feel like it . i don't think its a form a trust , more like ... i got typed 9 ' d to but it also so said i could be the thinker because it was a tie or something , i forgot which number it was . i think i got peacemaker because little word fights seem to waste time , ... i had to do an ' participate ' in a ice breaker yesterday at school , that was hell . it makes it really hard to talk to others like they want us to especially if its forced , i like to ninja my way to ... yep . i just use it right away . people who think they know me : i know you so well cause i've known you for ( insert time frame here ) , so that's how you are . what i said : i bet you do , i mean you said so so it must be true . what i ... i noticed i tend to relax , get relaxed a lot and instantly . i just enjoying laying down for no reason sometimes , and a bit randomly too . i just at a friend's house , he said we had to wait ten minutes ... nope none of my friends were meet through common activities or interests and don't really revolve around it at first . i mean video games and games outside we do , but i've never made a friend through ... nah i can't even if my life depended on it . one time i was almost i felt at the edge and my short yell died down so fast it was excatly like this ' i don't ... care . you win , your right , whatever i ... wow that first comment got negative real fast . i've been seventeen for about half an hour , my senior year starts next month , and then i'll be eighteen and on my own . does anything good in particular happen for senior year ? did you do a senior ... i'll just go with lone wolf , they should make one with that as a title . i wonder how accurate it would be . you can find big boobs anywhere i think a cute face is about the best physical attraction feature for me . too bad i'm too lazy or uninterested to think past ' oh she's pretty or whatever ' . i might be ... i do the upgrading and fixing of anything i own and like , i get actually get pissed off enough to show it for about eight seconds if anyone tries to do what i was going to do for me , but i go back to ... mechanic and body repair apprentice . looks like i'm a stereotype . ... * turns away and leaves hopefully unnoticed * * shivers * a place no ones allowed except me and maybe one other allowed to visit for short times . as for looks i'd like to keep most of it a secret , plus there too many details , but one thing i'm ok with ... i curious to find out how many friends an istp usually has . i have three , and is starting to lean to four soon . i know there my friend if i actually hang out with them after school or just when i ... i dunno i think i'd go for a enfp girl . i don't know why but i find them interesting when observing them , they always have a hand that keeps reaching out for you that peeks my interest even though my ... loyalty . i can be anywhere far away , doing just about anything for a long time , but as long as you'd be waiting for me i'd be fine . that includes when i'm next to you and silent , i care about you ... nah he's a good guy , i think he mostly does it cause he knows i'll have a little spaz out over it . and as for the fool if i'm or i'm not the fool i'll choose to be a fool , life is way more ... wait what was that part about about rejecting and getting even more on my tail . the last thing i want is more attention which makes everyone ask more questions about me ... what have i done !
