' does anyone know what the mbti type is of the lead singer of collective soul , ed roland ? i get the impression that he is an isfp , but i don't know for sure . here is an interview with him and ... reviving an old topic . i agree , he is definitely an xnfp . a lot of his lyrics are very ne ; never knew we were living in a world and the world is an open court , maybe we don't want to live ... i disagree . i personally think he was a fi-dom . i suspect that one of my friends and my maths teacher are both istjs . it's interesting , because even though there are quite a few differences ( in terms of decisions , actions ) , i can sense that they ... asd 456 thanks for the clarification . :) it's definitely less confusing now . :P i think i'm going to have to read up on type 4 sp / sx and type 9 sp / sx , to see which one i can really ... please stop putting words into my mouth . i have never said that superyoshi is butthurt asd 456 true . i had a look on the enneagram wikipedia page and read the basic descriptions for each type , however it still isn't really clear to me which type i might be . i'm definitely a 4 or a 9 , ... i completed the same enneagram test twenty minutes ago and this was the result i received . 71114 i wish i knew for sure which enneagram type i am ! : unsure : i guess it is possible that i could be a type 9 . i can relate to a fair few of the type 9 descriptions and i remember i was even typed as being a 9w1 on one enneagram test ( the one where i got the ... yeah , me too . inthe 00s is a lot more active as well and has more interesting discussions . i'm interested in hearing other people's opinions on this . i only found out a few days ago that i am a 4w5 sp / sx . would a 4w5 sp / sx infp come across as being more cold and detached in comparison to ... actualized type : infp ( who you are ) introverted ( i ) 74.19 % extroverted ( e ) 25.81 % intuitive ( n ) 60 % sensing ( s ) 40 % feeling ( f ) 64 % thinking ( t ) 36 % perceiving ( p ) 70.37 % judging ( j ) 29.63 % ... i think my friend's reaction to this comment made in my english subject today , is a good example of something an istj would say . whenever we do exams , our marks are scaled depending on how well the ... 709778 i'm an infp without a doubt , but i undertook a cognitive test a couple of minutes ago and ni was actually one of my highest functions . i scored 65 % in ni , but only 25 % in fe . although it's ... that's why i feel as though i can't really identify solely with type 4 . i had a read of the descriptions of type 4 since you posted this , and a lot of them just don't jump out at me as being ... very true . :P i don't know too much about enneagram types , but i agree that sp type fours sound the most grounded out of the three . although , i suppose any type can come across as being grounded , ... possibly . also , despite being a probable 4w5 , i do rank quite highly in type 6 . in the first enneagram test , type 6 was my second most likely type and in the second test i did , i was listed as being ... thank you for the response . :) i forgot to share it in my earlier post , but i also did a tritype enneagram test and i got 4-5- 1 , so i probably am a 4w5 . even though , i can definitely relate to ... i really seem to be stuck between being a type 4 and a type 6 . here are the results i have received from doing two different enneagram tests . based on those results , i don't really lean towards being ... he is definitely a fi-dom , in my opinion . i think it just comes down to whether he used ne or se as his auxiliary . what do you think ? i'm leaning towards infp , but i'm bias , so that may skew my ... i agree . personally , i don't think anyone born in the ' 70s should be considered a millennial . most sources tend to view late ' 70s babies as being gen x as well , so it's strange that personality cafe ... 1 . 2010 2 . 2011 3 . 2017 4 . 2015 5 . 2013 6 . 2014 7 . 2016 8 . 2012 i would also rule out * ntj , because i think he definitely is a feeler ( albeit , an unhealthy one ) . xsfp and xnfj are the only plausible types , in my opinion . out of my own functions , probably tertiary si . it makes me remember past events which have been horrible for me personally and because the function combines with my dominant fi , it makes for a really ... i assume no one here watches this show then ? : tongue : not only that , but i think he heavily relies on fi as well . the show is based on assessing his own personal morals and what is or isn't right . he's definitely not a fe user , in my opinion . i consider both 2006 and 2007 to be my peak childhood years . :) no one said that people born in 2000 are completely different from 2001 babies . i just think it's strange that a lot of 2000 ' ers view themselves as either millennial or gen y / z cusp , but from what ... whenever i hear / watch this , it immediately transports me back to 2005 . it makes me feel nostalgic every time ! i was born in march 1999 , so i would be a mid-late 2000 ' s hybrid kid . since i was 5-10 between 2004 and 2009 , my core childhood was equally split between the two . that's why i don't feel as though ... it isn't a bad thing . at the end of the day , generation labels really don't play a part in everyday life . besides , at least you know for certain which generation you're apart of . i'm pretty much ... i know that it's not much of an age difference in the scheme of things , but it's still strange for me to see comments from people saying that they can only vaguely remember 2005 or 2006 . : tongue : this is a question to anyone who was born in the early 2000s : have any of you ever considered yourselves to be a gen y / millennial at some point or have you always thought of yourself as being a gen ... i have one or two vivid memories from age 3 as well , but they are not as clear as my memories from age 4 onwards . despite what people suggest , i think age 4 can go either way ; it can either be an ... sorry , but i also don't agree with a lot of the chart . childhood is universally considered to be between the ages of 3-12 . i personally can't say that i have ever heard of the age bracket of 5-12 for ... i understand what you mean , but as longaotian 00 pointed out , you only experienced one year of your core childhood in the 2000s . you were 6-9 years old in the early 2010s , which was the bulk of your ... i was born in march 1999 and i have felt the same way in the past , particularly when some people have suggested that those born in 1998 are the last of the gen y / z cuspers . however , with that said , ... as an 18 year old , i personally consider people who are between the ages of 16-21 as being my peer group , so that basically equates to 1996-2001 borns . i'm sure that will definitely change as i ... why july 1999 ? i guess that doesn't include me then , considering that i was born in march 1999 . : tongue : age 2 is early childhood , not core childhood . childhood is generally defined as being between the ages of 3-12 , with 5/6- 10 being someone's core childhood . you may be able to remember one or two ... i was born in 1999 , so i was 11-14 years old in the early 2010s . i still think it's way too soon to be overly nostalgic for the early 2010s . maybe it's just the fact that a lot of you were only 8 or ... i know i posted earlier in this thread , but i now have a better understanding of the types , so i will give it another go . no one in my family has ever had their mbti type confirmed , but i highly ... no , there's a difference . people born between 2000-2002 experienced most of their childhood in the 2000s . they are 2000 ' s kids . someone born in 2005 was only two years old in 2007 , when the first ... how the hell is someone born in 2004 or 2005 a 2000s kid ? they wouldn't even be able to remember the mid 2000s , which was when 2000s culture was at its peak . born in march 1999 : earliest memories : 2001 first year i can vividly remember : 2003 i can understand if you can remember a few things from the mid / late 2000s . i have a good memory from when i was a toddler as well , so i know how it feels . however , even if you have a really good ... 698882 what do you think the mbti types are of bradley walsh ( the host ) and the chasers on the show ? bradley walsh - isfj . i think he uses fe and he is definitely a sensor . mark labbett ... jeez that makes me feel old . : tongue : sorry , but i really don't think you could be considered a hybrid 2000s / 2010s kid . you're solidly an early 2010s kid , in my opinion . i can remember as far back as 2001 , but that doesn't make me a ... most of you will probably be skeptical about this , but the first major worldwide event i can remember is 9/11 . i was 2.5 years old at the time , but i can very vaguely remember seeing the coverage of ...
