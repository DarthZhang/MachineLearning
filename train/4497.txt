belle - - infp jasmine - - don't know , but if i had to guess i'd say perhaps entp pocahontas - - infj or infp ... i vote enfj . he's sooo fe . i dunno . he's a toughie ! i would say either entp or istp . odd choices to be sure , but ... i have no explanation haha . he said somewhere that he tries to make himself out to look like a tough guy with ... i'm an actor-in-training . i have a theory about actors ... i think there are fi actors and fe actors . fi actors are the ones who give us the most genuine emotional expression . they may play the ... my best friend is an enfj . that , coupled with the fact that we're lifelong best friends and cousins , makes us feel like we're basically the same person . nobody understands me like she does . i can ... :d ry : yes . that's exactly what i'm trying to do . my theatre professor / director is an entp . he's like the dad i never had . he's in his late 50s , so his fe is very developed , but he is in every way a typical entp . we get along fantastically well ... favorite thing = biceps . and bicep tattoos that stick out from under t shirts . and hipster glasses . and scruff . and butts . nice butts . hahaha not to derail the thread further but i am convinced emma stone is an enfp . anyway ... i never thought about enfj for chris ! that is a good idea . do you guys think he's an intuitive ?
