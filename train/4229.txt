' how is that even anatomically possible ? uhhh , i'm an intp actually , i don't know why it says intj , or why my country is black-private ( what is black-private anyway ? how does india even come under that ? ) aaaand , i embarrassed to day this ... everyone here seems to be either too fast or too slow , am i the only one here who does things at a normal pace ? be it eating or writing or anything else . that easy huh ? well yes , that is indeed how i reached the conclusion , i did try to do a few more but only drew a blank . guess i'm not ready to be sherlock yet . i'm going to make a wild deduction from your room and say you're left handed . am i right ? i was born i a family of j types . i'm the only p type in a family of 6 , you can imagine what my life must be . i can't remember a movie at the moment but ' new girl ' if you're doing tv shows too . i guess i'm the only one here who has no idea what a rick roll is , i'm just gonna take a wild guess and say it has something to with rick astley ? i'm 16 by the way . i know 2 intps in my class who are definitely intps ( i had them take the test , multiple times ) so that makes it 3 intps in a total of 32 people . so , who knows , maybe his / hers is an exceptional case ... then i guess i should be thankful for the mathematics teacher i have because when he starts off any theorem or formula , he starts with the basic of assumptions and then just keeps going all the while ... you sir , have not had the opportunity to appreciate mathematical beauty . i am definitely trying this . water . i don't know , i'll probably drink it ? you're an intp all right if my judgement is anything to go by , and you're command on mathematics does not change the fact . i need some clarification on this , my understanding of the differences between the two is intuitive at best . i have read a little bit about it but still don't have a proper understanding of it , i ... looks like i'm the only one here who doesn't have an image of his own mind , its just emptiness , emptiness stretching out infinitely in every direction and whatever i'm thinking of just springs out of ... you take anything to infinity , mathematics is likely to break down , for example say s = 1-1+ 1-1+ 1 ... s = 0 +1-1+ 1-1 ... add those you get s = 1/2 = 0 , which is stupid . my ... its simple , you don't . that is ... a very logically sound argument , i'm impressed . kudos to you . that is what i said , we don't have to write mathematical equations and argue about vectors , just a normal discussion kinda thing , anyways , i got my answer , this is a hangout forum . straight line with slope 3 ? i have been on this sub forum for some time and most of the posts here are either about mbti or daily life stuff . what about discussing physics ? or chemistry ? or any of the hard sciences ? i know ... he actually does , what i think he means is that while it may be ' pseudo science ' , it is still a pretty accurate model for making descriptions and predictions , so it can still be accepted as a model ... i was looking for a comment like this . thank you , for making my day . any intp here who enjoys team sports ? any at all ? just lie down and stare into empty space and think about something that i forget about in 2 days . i gave this example only to show that iq doesn't determine intelligence , not to show off . what do you think i'm going to get by comparing myself to him anyway ? it does happen a lot , especially when i'm talking with the sf types , also the fact that i talk fast doesn't help it , i repeat myself twice and if they still don't get it ( which is most of the times ) ... i think a stephen hawking quote would be enough to describe my life goal my goal is simple . a complete understanding of the universe , why it is as it is and why it exists at all . and trying my hand at deductions ( i just binge watched the series again , so its just the sherlock effect ) currently i'm obsessed with three dimensional geometry , ok not obsessed i'm just starting it but its rather interesting . not really , not even hugs from my family members , with friends i don't have a problem , i don't know i just feel awkward if its not a friend ( close one ) . ughhh , you're right , after re-reading it , it does sound obnoxious , his friend just might have the don't-tell-me-what-to-do and i-already-know-it-you-dont-have-to-tell-me-that type reaction . this is ... if i were you , i'd just point out the flaw in his logic , like , weighing the pros and cons ( there aren't actually any pros ) and tell him why procrastinating is stupid and then call him stupid for ... physics , computer programming and engineering . also a little bit of philosophy . exactly ! i meant plot the x and y co-ordinates on a graph , i understand the point of the equation , just plot the values you get on an x-y plane , see what do you get , i tried another equation similar to this , ... so , the rationals here have got rational . * shots fired * ? ? i have already tried this approach my friend , it was the first thing i tried , plot the points for it , you will see only 8 points satisfying this equation . nice try though . akiyama exactly , it is one of my favourite things to do , solving geometrical problems using equations ( btw , i was thinking of there is and equation for a square , still cant find it , any ideas ? ) i love both actually but to me , algebra is more fun and oddly satisfying . hal haha , i feel you brother , i was thinking about making a thread about this , while i don't have anything against philosophy ( i actually do quite some philosophical thinking ) but i think it's not of ... i actually follow through projects that i build up in my mind ( albeit not immediately ) but i eventually complete them . well , it is a skill to identify and connect with others emotionally , feeling what others are going through , giving them emotional support but i don't think it is intelligence , it is just a skill , you ... correction : author is christopher c doyle . well , i have an iq of 138 to 145 , somewhere in that range and there is a ' friend ' of mine with an iq of 152 or something ( he claims so ) but he is dumb as shit and i can beat him in any intellectual ... so i was reading this book called the alexander secret ( christopher doyle ) it was a thriller / sci-fi type book and in the book , the main scientific idea was that the micro organisms have been evolving ... and also pseudo intellectuals , they bloody irritate me with their ' unique ideas ' and ' great wisdom ' . when i'm super excited about and idea and explaining it to someone and they gowait , what ? i didn't quite understand what you said and they ask me to repeat myself , i just dismiss them with a ' never ... damn it ! you beat me to it ( btw , it was ren√© descartes ) '
