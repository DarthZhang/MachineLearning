' i love bj√∂rk . she has such an independent and innovative methodology . i want to say she's ni dominant . her sound is always changing , but she does each iteration to such completion . so ... inxj . i'm always listening to music . usually , i'll play games and listen to different albums , artists , genres , eras , etc . i write and produce my own music . that's fun and challenging , and i try to make a ... i would strip down , and mark my territory . then i'll watch how long it takes people to stay quiet . 200450 spirit of eden u200b - talk talk the joker is pure evil . one dimensionally , unquestionably , irredeemably evil . and he is so fascinating ! ! ! so , complexity works to a point . sometimes , just being a massive son of a bitch is all ... any jane austen novel , right ? she was supposedly an intj . so , there's that . no . we're not critical enough . why the hell are we not laying down our criticisms more liberally and more aggressively ? ? ? now ... 1 . we have the facts and we're voting yes - death cab for cutie 2 . bon iver , bon iver - bon iver 3 . ok computer - radiohead 4 . illinois - sufjan stevens 5 . let it be - the replacements this is a date movie for couples who have been in relationships for a long time . not a first date movie at all . in fact , not really a great date movie at all . watch something cute , like lars ... no it is not . it's about sisters , but not why the idea of sisterhood is inherently more powerful . and anna is only able to rescue elsa because of a male . and what bond ? that's contradictory . these ... well , why not push that angle ? why not make a real statement about sisterhood that is devoted almost exclusively to this ? why not give both anna and elsa some true , introspective moments ? no , ... oh gosh ... let's see , the postmodernism was stupid . so predictable , and not particularly well observed . you can't marry someone you just met . that's been a criticism of disney films for years ... i want this movie to die already . i'm so sick of it . to be fair , it's not terrible , but it has to be the most overrated shit ever taken . just ... not particularly inventive or interesting . it's funny , ... i always take the reverse of appealing to ignorance on the matter . there's so much we don't know , so much that is too neat , and so much that is too huge , for me not to believe there isn't a god . now , ... social anxiety doesn't excuse or erase being shitty . and her voice isn't any prettier than any generic pop singer out there . the only difference is that she acts sleepy , and somehow that subdued ... i think they're instilling empathy into their kids . slowly , but surely , those kids need to realize that a world exists outside their sphere of reality , and they are not above the law . kids need to ... not really . love is irrational , so to act as if it's some concept that can be deconstructed and made logical is not how i want to spend my time . that being said , i know exactly what i want in another ... my favorites ?
