' do you like chatting on the phone ? no . do you prefer text to phone calls ? why ? yes . short and to the point . my most used reply would be ' ok ' . what is proper phone etiquette for you ? don't call me ... you're onto something there i think ! his previous relationships have probably taught him that he cannot say things as they are , so he is adapting , thus hiding the truth from you . most girls don't ... how do you know he doesn't have that insight ? he probably lives in the moment , enjoying what's he's having without worrying too much about what he might not have . forgetting about something ... yay ! my score was binary ! i usually don't have any problems falling asleep , unless there is something really important i need to think through . however , i am not very good at going to bed , and even if i tell myself to go to ... i know one , but she's a friend , not someone i could have a relationship with . people really ought to have their type written in big letters on their front and back so that you didn't have to ... i sometimes wonder what an istp-istp relationship would be like ... i prefer the reply you never know ! ... running in the rain is great too . i think anything except eating ice cream is great in the rain ... * * f * ( i don't like using ' dear ' ) get off my back and stop asking me what i'm feeling . i think , therefore i am . my very own istp i think that's why some people like to talk to me about their problems . it's also why some of them change their mind and walk away , when they find out that i say what i think ( which is based on logic ... it's not just you . i don't own an umbrella . i can relate to your op ( cba to read through all the posts tbh ) . after my divorce i was alone with the house . most people wouldn't live in a house in the condition it was in at the time ( i was ... i preferred playing alone with my toys . i also liked looking out the window , just observing the outside world . when i got mad , i got really mad . i usually took it out on my toys , breaking some of ... ^ ^ this ! / 10char go for the latter ! if you try to draw it out of him you will end up with a very frustrated istp . he might do it at first to try to please you but it will backfire on you . you don't want him to say ... the real advantage of that would be that you don't have to hear about everything they feel ... * sigh * yes , very much so ! one of my best friends - also an istp - and i used to sit in the same room , each with our laptop and a movie on the tv without saying anything other than the occasional comment ... your comment about being good at fixing things can easily make some people uneasy . especially women , i think , as they often tend to have lower self-esteem than most men . if it's true , what's wrong in ... yes . i am way more serious when at work than at home . that's natural . it has been a surprise to some of my female acquaintances when they have called me at work . as others have said , you don't get your istp friend to talk to you . forcing him to do so would probably end up in a very awkward conversation - especially for your friend . you'll probably be able to ... yes ! i'm binary ! how do i find put whether my picture is there ? i do this , and i know it . what's so wrong with that ? why would i care what someone must have felt before doing something , if doing it isn't rational ? i wish more people would actually think instead ... done ! / 10char not necessarily more important , but it is equally important . if i have been around people too much i need to go hide in one of my man caves . if i don't get ' istp time ' ( as i call it ) i get frustrated ... i have a man cave ... well , two actually ... best places in the whole house ! :) just say it ! :D ^ this ! my experience tells me that once one part wants a divorce there is no turning back , no matter whether or not you have tried working it out for years . my own divorce came out of the blue ... my dad recently told me that he wouldn't be surprised if i had lived my life as a hermit . if all else fails , that's still an option . ;) it was something i read the other day about istps and relationships . someone just pointed out that ships always sink . if you think it through you'll see that all relationships will end eventually ... + 1 , though only swimming . clean cut is the way to go . oh , the joy of having so-called family members not worth talking to ... :) i think my parents would be the main reason for not doing what you did . i was recently in a situation where i really felt like saying ' f * * * it all ' and start all over . i knew it wouldn't be that ... + 1 i have often wondered whether that is actually possible - and how other people would react . well thank you . you do know ships always sink , don't you ? ;) so i've heard . a friend of mine - also an istp - had twins recently , and before she gave birth to them she could joke about giving away one of them , but she's all different now . i think it has been ... a man-purse ? i don't carry a pocket knife . no need to , i just find another way to open / cut whatever i need to open or cut . + 1 i can spend hours / days finding information on something like colour patterns and productions blocks so that i can draw my own conclusions . i have more than 400 books on the subject , but i ... yes , that part of the world ... you're probably right . i don't have kids yet , but i guess i will change when i get some . after all , their love is unconditional . ;) 20266 well , that's me ... smiling ... that reminds me of how i invented the wireless mouse ... and keyless keyboard . only the former was a success ... if he's anything like me he will just absorb the small things that annoy him , it will accumulate and he will be filled with rage one day . he might not take it out on you ( i hope ! ) , but he might punch ... thanks for taking me back to the 90s . :P what's love ? when the decision has been made - and i have always given it a lot of thought - i usually stand by it . haven't always done that , so it's something i have learned . never go back ! it will not change ... yes . the only one in the house with a better sense of smell is my dog . i have had several relationships that lasted more than a year . even been married too . i tend to get over break-ups rather easily , and my major concern when my ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce was ...
