( he's an entp btw ) it's weird . i tend to forget specifics of conversations , but i desperately don't want to lose them , so written communication is always great . in some days i'll have a new mobile and i don't know how ... me again .. what's your view of the introvert part ? do you like it or does it frustrate you ? great , the boyfriend finally revealed why he's so distanced the last months : he thinks i am depressed and because of betrayal and getting hurt by two close , depressed people in the past he shies away ... great , the boyfriend finally revealed why he's so distanced the last months : he thinks i am depressed and because of betrayal and getting hurt by two close , depressed people in the past he shies away ... ;) this typology .. so reliable it depends . i can forgive a lot and every person is as imperfect as me . i always hope that my failures and flaws are forgiven . it gets difficult when the conflict is not resolved when i and the ... hm .. in parts you're right ; i experience it this way . i vs e can clash like that , but keep always in mind it depends on how much pronounced the e or i is . i can recommend this book by marti ... yeah , most of our miscommunications are because of that . but now i know a bit better how be both tick we can handle the extrovert / introvert differences pretty good .. but as said before every ... i am so pissed of with myself . i cant finish this thesis and time is literally running out . it seems like i finally could get a job and wouldn't rely on my parents ' money anymore . but i cant't finish ... i think i've always fallen between these two and have never been satisfied . i could always empathize with the quiet and shy ones who where often the as you call it ' nerds ' ( we don't have this term or ... this . as they seem to connect with everyone i keep wondering what they see in me or any other person . do you , entps , like everyone or do you just like to talk with them ? um .. i didn't use constellation in any astrology meaning . sometimes it's a bit difficult to pick the right words in a foreign language ;) um .. i don't quite understand this .. they are conflicting and at the same time duals ? i already read that this constellation can have lots of conflicts but when they overcome them they can ... the earth explodes . kidding they get hurt . might be terrible if you don't want to lose them ;) i worry about personal relationships .. being in serious relationship for the first time and then with this fabulous , self-confident person is sometimes stressful :) esl means english as a second ... i just see a lot of similarities between us . we have the same values , humor , possible life choices , interests etc . i am drawn to his personality like never to one before . he often speaks out loud ... why do you think don't they get along ; what are their arguments about and in which way does their behaviour conflict ? i just want to realise if their behaviour is similar to ours .. and i ... i second all of this ! i am fairly new to mbti and enneagramm but i tested 2w1 , 9w1 , 6w5 . i don't know how common or off this is for an infj .. did you have any solution ? what's the current status ? i feel like i am in the exact situation , so your experiences would help me a lot to figure out myself and us ! what's an unhealthy / mature entp like ? i looked at my results again and there's a fine line between infj / isfj . the results in the second category were closer than any other . but i suppose the ... from my side it's just good to know how he works . after some time and reading stuff about entps it's much clearer for me . i never have been close to such a type , so i haven't had an orientation on ... what would these little details be ? and if you don't care about them anyway wouldn't it be indifferent if someone does for you ? funny to see how one can make assumptions because of personality types that are way off and as you see can differ a lot . for myself i a much clearer about why we can get stuck in debates , because at ... guys , this was suppossed to be a thread for good examples ! :P sorry you had these experiences , but it doesn't has to be the same for us here . even if you know one isfj doesn't mean you know them ...
