[ the fox ] said . i want to , very much , the little prince replied . but i have not much time . i have friends to discover , and a great many things to understand . one only ... i so agree with you in all the points you made , specially on this : there are people who read my words and think i only have one perspective on it , which isn't true . i have dozens upon dozens ... i agree with stelmosdream and toma , great advices . i also believe art is really helpful , any kind of art will help you express and vent your strong emotions or even the external emotions that are ... rofl i love how we are able to extract such meaningful things from such random outlets like a song about a tour deal to ride a bus around to perform * chuckles * awesome lyrics though , to me , this ... sweetish , all the things that you wrote recently really touched me . i have experienced this too . that darn idea of having enough love for both of us , of letting yourself be destroyed to try and heal ... totally know what you mean ... but let us not loose hope , it would be sad to turn into the things we have been fighting to protect others from . that's great news scootaloo , i am really happy for you ! yes _zac_ and overwhelmedone , let us hope ... hugs for you both i am really glad you had such a good clossure , i hope one day she realizes what she did , for her own good . * hug * i know what you mean . once my dearest friend started to talk carelessly about his health and joking around , when he knew my family has been through a lot of painful sickness and near dead moments and ... so been there ! ! ! no idea why sickness puts me to bed like i'm dying , it's really frustraiting . and don't get me started on allergies ... just wanted to say ditto . i am not a missanthrope , i just deelpy hate the society we built ... lyricalwhip thank you for your beautiful words , you brought warmth to my soul and made me smile . thank you . callisto 88 i know how you feel , it is hard not to get the selfesteem shaken and trust ... i completely agree with you , becoming cynical would only take away our own essence ! and yes , inspite all the pain and frustration shared in here , it is a place filled with warmth . indeed , but the bright part is , an overflowing heart can feel the sweetest of joys and tenderness as well . though , i completely understand you , sometimes it just hurts too much . * hug * marla_s what a lovely idea ! to be honest i am a bit afraid , i kinda suck at introducing myself and am sure will feel like i left the most important parts out when i'm done tee hee ! but here we go ... t-t thank you for such beautiful , comforting words . perhaps you are right and we are just craving for that overwhelming love only god can give ... it is not that we don't love to give without ... i think for me , letting go is extremely hard , one of the reasons i found the idea of dating quite crazy , was because people often seem to date , get to know each other deeply and when things don't ... oldmanrivers , i always love the beauty and depth within your posts . i am deeply hurt , i wish so bad i could stop withdrawing because i can't imagine my life without this person , i feel guilty but i ... i don't know about other infjs , i think it probably is a part of the in , but i love ironies in life and light sarcasm as well , i can laugh about myself a lot too , but yes , you should probably avoid ... agreed , don't ever say / promise things you don't mean . infjs know when you are lying or hiding parts of the truth .
