' sorry to revive a dead thread , but thank you everyone , especially muchaparadox and paradox 1987 . i gave it a lot of thought , but ultimately i don't want to have to put on a suit of armor too much ... hi . sorry , i'm a little busy to read through your entire thread right now ( law school eats my life ) , but just an answer to your basic question--my isfj boyfriend of over a year is crazy enough to ... my personality has changed dramatically since i went to law school . i've become so much more organized , i now plan everything , i calculate . i don't think i'm optimistic anymore . i'm just jaded . yet ... tbh i don't think my isfj cares about wastage of any sort : cooking , spending , etc . * tends to be much more cautious about these things than he is * i think it can work . i'm a enfp / entp and i've been dating an isfj for ~ 9 months now and we've been getting along great . though tbh i'm probably more soft-hearted and justice-oriented than the typical ... i listen to all kinds of songs but generally i'm magnetically drawn to the overly optimistic / hopeful sounding ones like these below . ( i've actually been addicted to all of the songs below for days ... hahaha . yes it's an isfj thing . my isfj showers me ... and my family with gifts even when i tell him it's not necessary . my isfj boxes ( in metal cages ) with his friends for fun . he's good at it . :) perhaps he's not your typical isfj . haha ... i know one of my isfjs annoyances are when people don't say hi or smile to him . yes my isfj was not quite depressed , but just generally sad before he met me . now he's smiling all the time and is generally the happiest , most good natured person i know . go figure . :) hi , i'm an enfp / entp dating an isfj and i'll try to answer this according to what we've been through ... 1 . does it bother you if your platonic friend spends time with others or starts to get close ... how would i react ? me : ... bring it ! let's see who'll die in the end ... ;) my isfj : would probably take it as a joke and laugh / joke about it . well i'm a enfp / entp dating an isfj and all our friends and family think we're crazily compatible so i vote for that . though to be honest our compatibility is much more than simply mbti type ( though ... my isfj is probably more of a light masochist , only in a certain situation , if that helps any . :) my isfj is an awesome listener though i can kinda relate to what you're saying but in a different sense--he's not so good at responding . so in that sense , it may be slightly unrelated but it seems ... so this is what my isfj says ... are isfj less sexually permissive ? if doing things every day is less sexually permissive , i guess so . :P are isfj very monogamous ? yes . what are isfj ' s ... so i know there's a bit of a language barrier--but even if i look past that , i'd say don't go into this relationship . sounds like a fun flirting relationship , but a disastrous romantic ... here's my advice . go befriend one of those enfp-type people , the happy-go-lucky friendly smiley types . we love to give out genuine compliments . :) it's like our life . dating an isfj for ~ 6 months ... mcrts : yeah you know , i can't figure out why there's all this bad rep about entp / isfj relationships . sure i think it could be a disaster if the two didn't have the same ideas about things or same ... enfp / entp dating isfj for ~ 6 months here . :) so far compatibility has been nearly phenomenal compared to all other personality types i've dated ( infj , intj , istp , isfp , intp ... etc . ) i could ... i'm not an isfj , but as an entp / enfp dating an isfj what's been said is pretty much true . this isfj has also helped grow a lot simply because he's so kind and his kindness makes me very willing to ... i'm an enfp / entp that's dating an isfj ~ though i look like an enfp , i'm probably an entp because i need an logical explanation for absolutely everything , such as why this isfj is driving me so ... i'm anywhere that's inspiring / hopeful / creative . :) i also love being around crowds of positive / happy people . concerts , dancing , fairs , karaoke , nature walks , art classes , trying something ... actually i used to score f on most of my tests , but now i score mostly t ... and the question of , do i use my heart or my head ? i used to solely use my head and ignore feelings all together . now ... hi :D so i've been debating this forever . enfp or entp ? i test out as both , depending on the test . both personality descriptions fit me . i also did the cognitive functions test and though i wasn't ... err ... actually i found out that person was an isfj after testing him multiple times haha . ... my baddd .. most of the enfps here seem to love infjs to pieces but i'm back to the i don't know if i ... i went to a funeral service today for my teacher's husband . i didn't want to go , i didn't know him , but i went anyway . my teacher came up to the podium and started describing his life . i expected ... haha . maybe this isn't limited to just males . i know i really look like an entp to the world : calm , logical , unemotional ... but then if you see me with people i trust or behind closed doors you'll ... thanks for all the responses ! it's really helped me understand this a bit more . i've probably been trying to understand / analyzing everything too much . :) but going back to theory , i probably ... can someone please explain why my best fit personality type ( infj ) , is the type i argue with the most ? theoretically , we should get along swimmingly ! but when i meet actual infjs ( i've met about ~ 5 ... i just met another infj . :D i changed my mind . ilovethemilovethemilovethem - squeal - been talking to this person for ~ 3 straight days now and for some reason i can't stop smiling . :) they're so ... you're amazing ! umm .. how does it work ? :| well maybe it's cause intjs have this cold exterior and enfps can break through that . that and we have this cute , happy quality about us that is so pure .. * cough * i ... ohmigosh . yes i do . i do all of the above . : 3 skip , frolic , dance . i even sing and spin while doing all of the above . :D oh yes . well when i was young i was an infp / intp mix . now i've just given up on being quiet and have become an enfp / entp mix . ... have i always been like a ( how i read it ) a little disney princess ? why ye - i ... ... well , i think i like them . i say that cause half of the ones i know drive me crazy . o_o they seem to have the weirdest train of thought ever . but somehow ... just somehow , i still really like ... i'm just so happy ! :D no , no i'm not drunk . i'm not high . i'm just happy , so full of life ! so full of laughter ! i was so sure this part of me had disappeared forever ! so ... what good thing ... what personality trait or personal obstacle do you struggle to overcome as an enfp ? ... i have cycles of sadness / depression . :| it comes and goes . i'm not sure if it's worse because of the monthly ... basically anything my estj friend doesn't like . :P anything weird or wacky like ... that headband with a huge cupcake complete with candles and streamers ... i thought that was pretty cool , honestly ! i ... when you feel so warm and full to bursting with happiness from suddenly realizing ( again ) that there's so much you can do to make the world a better place ... there's so much you can do ... no , they don't ! ( intimidate me . ) but maybe that's cause i'm a borderline enfp / entp ? : 3 i find they're one of the few types that can keep up with my thought process / heartily debate with me ... my confession ... i wish my happiness tornado would keep spiraling up . <3 i love it . keeps me motivated and happy ~ all i really need is one or a few people around me i can laugh / be silly with . :D ... yes i do . :D i love feeling ! it's great ! sometimes it's from sadness or happiness ... usually happiness . : 3 thank you everyone ! i took your advice and i just took the whole day off for myself today . :D it was wonderful . being alone without having any pressure really helped . :) ... * so happy it's ... so a year ago i was all happy and chirpy . then all sorts of things happened . :( i started studying for an exam to get into school for half a year and basically locked myself up in a library for ... not being social ( like going out and actually talking to people ) for a while can really make me reclusive no matter what i'm doing . sometimes forcing myself to go out and mingle and chat with people ... hey krwheel . you are so incredibly insightful that it's almost terrifying . though it's also intriguing ... i only realized my own behavior after you pointed out all your gripes with enfps . yes , i ... lots and lots and lots of talking ! :D talking while walking . talking after eating . talking during some gathering ... or singing . singing is good too . so basically something where i can use my ... rhoalphanualpha's post is right on . :D i can tell you pretty much that's exactly how it goes ... isfps are very affectionate . i love it cause i need innocent affection that doesn't have anything ... hey . :D one of my closest friends is an isfp and we both can't imagine our lives without one another . i'm actually talking to him right now and trying to figure out how to answer this question for ...
