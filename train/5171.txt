i agree that she's an enfj and probably 6w7 , but i don't know enough about her to agree to the rest . yeah , i think that's it . yes , i am a synesthete ! :) i don't think i've watched the show as much as you probably have , but from what i've seen , your typings seem accurate . i always thought lana was an isfp 4w3 . i love her and her work , she's great . i also always thought he was infp . that's what i've always thought too . my guess is enfj . i've heard intp for him , but that's as much as i know . sorry . i'm an infj and an attention seeker , but i've always thought that was just because i'm a type 3 . actually , i learned this in my college psychology course ... it was in our textbook , which i no longer have . sorry ! i am sure you can find out about it online though . i personally just always assumed it was because those two types were most often interested in this kind of psychology and / or more likely to be online reading about it . lol . which do you think are most often mistyped by others and / or by themselves , or more likely to appear different from their type's stereotype ? or do you think there's no correlation at all ? it's actually scientifically proven that some general personality traits ( i . e . , open-mindedness , etc . ) correlate with music tastes . i agree with the above poster , although i think tiffany was more likely introverted . i really love infps and their capacity for emotion . it really takes my breath away . you can see what they're feeling in their eyes ; so much feeling is pooled in their eyes . they just seem closer to ... i'm pretty sure that matilda is an infj . and trunchbull does sound like an estj now that i think about it . if i had to guess , i'd say isfp . not sure though . i still think she's an infp 7w6 . just thought i'd add this . besides the quotes i posted on the first page of this thread , they asked her in this interview if she'd like to be a hermit , and she said ... pm'ed you guys too :) thank you all ! i pm'd . :) hi guys ! i'm currently writing a book in which a main character is an enfp 7w6 . now , i usually don't attribute myers-briggs types to characters , but this character is based off an enfp 7w6 girl that ... alright , – this is the gist of it . here are some quotes first : in the december 2009 issue of instyle , she said about how she writes her songs : the last three were pr . i don't want to clog up this thread , so i'll pm you . yep , taylor swift is an infj . i've been a huge fan for years . unfortunately the media ( and her pr team , which has screwed up ) has made it seem like she's dated tons of ... i promise you she's an infj , i've been a fan for years . i think she seems like an esfj because she's a type 3 . i'm also an infj 3w4 , and people never believe me when i tell them i'm an introvert . ... i know , i'm just saying . taylor swift is definitely an infj , but i know she's also a 3 , which sometimes makes her look like other types . cobain is an infp . einstein is intp . i don't know enough about the others to say . ... this is definitely true . she gets really nervous in front of crowds ( which she says is why she begins to talk non-stop and without thinking , but that's also why she often is tipsy interviews ( she ... wait , i change my mind about her enneagram . she seems like a 7 . i don't see how people see se in her ; she's said countless times that she couldn't care less about aesthetics or clothes or any of ... i think jennifer is a type 3 enneagram . she's always talked about how driven she was to be successful in acting and how competitive she is . thoughts ? i don't think this really means anything . i also don't like shy people and am usually way too talkative , but i'm still introverted ... gosh , i used to be a huge fangirl for her , lol . i had her typed in my mind as an esfp , but i could be wrong ; it's been a long time since i've read anything about her . she's an infp . we proved this in the hunger games thread that's stickied . i'll bring some stuff over : the difference is that your soulmate is your soulmate and is perfect for you , whereas the other person you like and get along with but ... it just ain't the same . i would rather get caught in the rain on a cold night without an umbrella . that sounds rather fun and romantic . haha . would you rather 1 ) meet your soulmate in your 20s but only get to spend 7 ... dan - infp - josh schwartz basically put himself in dan , and schwartz himself is an infp ( and he did the same with seth cohen in the o . c . , who's also an infp . ) blair - enfj rufus - enfp lily - ... this is a song taylor wrote when she was about twelve : isn't that ni ?
