also , i noticed that you created an account on inthe00s.com . welcome ! i agree with this . as a 2002 born i don â€™ t think i lean one way or another because i spent 5 years in the 00s and 5 in the 10s . and when i listen to songs from the years 2006-2013 i tend to get ... i was born in 2002 and i consider myself an ultimate late 00 ' s / early 10 ' s hybrid kid . since my childhood ended in 2014 , that means that i will spend all the second half of the 2010 ' s ( 2015-2019 ) as ... did you just bump this thread like longaotian said , early 2010 ' s peaked in the 2011 school year , or 2010-2011 school year . when i think of the early 10 ' s i usually think of the electropop era . electropop was still popular then ... i'd say the 2010-2011 school year was the peak of early ' 10 ' s and 2014-2015 school year was the peak of mid 2010 ' s culture , imo . whoever believes we are still in 90 ' s culture is clearly living under a rock . i can't even remember what i wore yesterday imo it should just be 13 + . i don't see what's wrong with teenagers joining this forum but then again i only joined this year . so i still don't fully know this website yet this thread has me like : 713329 i feel like i'm an early z for some reason lol . i don't consider myself gen y but i don't feel like i'm the peak of gen z lol . mathematically speaking , the exact start of the mid 90 ' s would be may 1 , 1993 . so it's both early and mid but it's mostly mid . in his other post , he said that the c / o 2020 was the first core z class . now he's saying the c / o 2018 is the first 100 % z class . i think it's safe to say that he definitely describes my signature ... couldn't agree more . age 5 was when i felt like my childhood truly started , and i was getting into kids stuff at that age . age 11 i was already graduating from elementary , and i was headed into ... well , that's exactly why i'm equally both , because i spent the first half in the 2000 ' s and the second half in the 2010 ' s . and my birthday is in april so i was 8 for most of 2010 . that guy needs to chill tbh . he's telling cooldudez he can't be on here cause he too young . but i'm just saying that as long as he is mature enough and doesn't start flame wars then he'll be fine . he is allowed to have his own opinion . i've never seen him get picked on just because of his age , and he's been here for about three months now . also , you are only two years older than him . that age gap isn't big in the grand scheme of ... maybe it's because he is mature , and doesn't get into arguments or start flame wars . and he's turnig 13 five months from now . like what sweetbaby said , i'd give him a chance . i agree . he probably won't be online for a long time tho . idk why . i remember first joining this website i was never asked to give out my birth date . that was after i created the account . and even then it's optional . i'm not sure what would happen if you set it to ... i'd say as long as he is mature enough and doesn't get into any flame wars , then he'll be fine . he's pretty chill tbh . just go to that thread . op ( aka my friend irl ) was born in 2003 . july to be exact . i was born in 2002 so i'm still older than you xd older than planet earth . just kidding . i'm 15 lol thanks lol . i kinda like inthe 00s a bit more than personality cafe when it comes to talking about generations . i feel like the community there is more friendlier for some reason personally , i feel more comfortable using the simple 3-12 definition since i think it's the easiest way and i'd say my core childhood for me was ages 5-10 which is why i think i'm an ultimate late ... sorry , but i don't agree with this . as a c / o 2020 member , i would not consider myself an outright 2010 ' s kid . i consider myself equally a 2000 ' s and 2010 ' s kid . period . not leaning 00 ' s or leaning ... i agree . i'm a sophomore in high school and i can easily relate to the seniors ( the one's born in 2000 ) i was born in 2002 7th grade is basically another version of 6th grade just new classes and learning new stuff so it's not even that different . you'll be fine . exactly lmao i'm older than all of you guys xd and hi lmao yes , i was born in 2002 and i do consider myself a 2000 ' s kid . 2000 ' s were the shit . kind of like my other thread but now we're ranking the years in music from best to worse . here's what i think : 1 . 2011 2 . 2010 3 . 2012 4 . 2013 5 . 2015 6 . 2016 7 . 2017 8 . 2014 representing for 2002 ;) 707617 only roblox players will understand . i'm three years late . i consider myself equally a late 2000 ' s / early 2010 ' s kid and a mid / late 2010 ' s teen . best response ever . the generation x span according to this website's definition is only 11 years long . they need to fix it . no i'm talking about your 13th birthday not your 12th lmao six months . ain't long from now . happy extremely extremely early birthday xd you guys talk like this is a role-playing game on roblox 2009 and 2010 were definitely my most peak childhood years that's like a person born in 1997 calling themselves a 2000 ' s baby even though they were a kid for every single year in that decade lmao that's how i feel as a 2002 born i'm not an outright 2000 ' s or outright 2010 ' s kid . it's like the last true 2000 ' s kids are a year older than me and the first true 2010 ' s kids are a year younger , ... i'm 15 , but i'm not really that into mbti types . i'm usually here for the generation stuff . it told me i was an isfp though . 2014 is as far away as 2020 . also as of today , april 1 , 2015 , is as far away as january 1 , 2020 .
