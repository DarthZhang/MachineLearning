' estp because 420 posts blaze it faggot . 334/467 intj and atheist / nihilist . istp's are only a step up from intp's , which doesn't say much . infp's never have any idea what there talking about , ever . yet they insist they do , and continue to pull shit out of their asses when debated . intp because that didn't make any sense , oh wait . infp because environmentalist stuff . enfp , because anime . off * enfp , make up your mind . and try and think through a decision every now and then . 80343ye shut ur face m8 but first a tip . 79534 [ / quote ] y ͮ ̉ ̽ ͭ ̈ ̚ ̽ ̚ ̛ ̝ ̠ ̘ ͓ ͅ ̯ ̼ ̠ ͍ ̹ ͔ ̰ ̟ ̼ ͓ ̣ o ͣ ͧ ̂ ͣ ̓ ̎ ̄ ̶ ̶ ̡ ̳ ̪ ͉ ͎ ͚ ͅ ͍ ̜ u ̾ ͒ ͣ ͛ ͤ ͥ ̓ ͩ ͫ ̐ ͧ ̚ ͡ ̨ ̦ ̫ ̳ ͓ ̟ ͎ ͉ ̣ ̣ ͇ ̖ ̻ ̙ ̖ ͈ ̙ ̬ ͕ ͚ ... but first a tip . 79534 79533 try and beat me in a staring contest . what 79482 yeah , there is a correlation . ( psst fi ) 78792 i've noticed that near all of the fi dom people i know are very liberal . k 78789 esfj - the ass-faced-bitch infj - the crybaby intp / infp - the pseudo intellectual i kind of feel sick when i act extroverted . while the zodiac its self is bullshit ; you lost all of your remaining merit when you said intx . i'm loud . why infj ? and enfp , because tennat . ( or at least it looks like tennant ) i'm back ; i have the camwhore urge coming on . enfp , because cute animal . and who's dumber ? the esfj , or the esfp ? it was made with flash ; ms paint doesn't have smoothing . and esfj , because you're a woman . ( not sexist in the least . ) isfj , because your avatar is a meme . 78430more brown than anything . why can't you decide on anything ? ! esfp because dancing woman as an avatar . enfp's are pretty cool . kind of hard to say anything bad about them . 78057 but how can you have ti and ni ? ! someone , please , explain , please . both your judging function and your perceiving function are introverted . what . si , the function of being close minded . i have no idea what that means . * chuckle * he think's he has ti . he doesn't know it , but he's an intp in denial ! edit : i was ninjad . and intp , please , do something with your life . that was more of a personal critique . and enfp's are pretty awesome , my only problem with them is that they suck at decision making . it's happening again ! i kind of assumed you were joking , but i just wasn't sure . dude , this is going way off topic . if you want to argue , you can do so privately via inbox . 77871 okay . you're * i think i know what's going on here . 77868 contain yourself within one post , please . and the multiple intelligences is an evaluation , not really a test ; so i could have just cheated ; you wouldn't have to copy it from google . and if you want ... i wasn't even a minute . edit : and you do know that a forum isn't an irc chat or anything , right ? reply's tend to take some time . i don't understand , at all . 77866 i'm an atheist .
