maybe you just met someone and you don't want them to find ... look sweetness , this is the internet i don't know what's true or not . all i was saying is that i wouldn't be surprised if some of those who voted 0 lied . here in the real life there are those who say ... you'd be surprised . lol 63 who said 0 are liarsss :p you gotta speak up and stand up for yourself . if you continue to let your friends or people in general do this the people and the world are going to walk all over you . it appears to me that you think less of yourself and that you're worrying about the little things . girls like it when you're nervous it only tells them that you're into them . you just have to calm ... i've considered deleting it as well . i just feel like it takes a lot of my time and when i don't respond to peoples messages they get mad and think i'm ignoring them . i have a few weird stories . for some strange reason gay guys seem to love to hit on me and it's probably because i don't notice that they're gay or hitting on me . when i worked at wal mart this ... my female friends rate me 8.5 but i have low self esteem and rate my self around a 6 . i take myself to a better place , a place where nothing can bring me down . for me it's playing soccer with my friends , not only do i forget everything but i feel better afterwards we all have that ... i'm not a big reader but i managed to find water for elephants in my sisters room , i read a few pages and i'm loving it so far . being active outside , jogging , playing soccer and most importantly spending time with the family . that's the only fun a person needs , forget about spending the whole night getting wasted and not ... by doing stupid thing's you would not think of doing for anyone else . she is so unhappy with her life that the only thing that makes her feel better is bringing down other people and making them feel as miserable as you . i dealt with these kinds of people and trust me ... o no cuteness :( but ... im excited to watch me some soccer katt williams or gtfo :) well of course everything has changed now , the thing's she told you before she won't tell you again because shes looking out for your feelings . she knows you like her and the only way for you to get ... god i feel old at 21 , just the other day i couldn't wait to turn 21 and here i am > _ > time goes by too fast . i'm 5 ' 11 155lbs . i work out on a daily basis . i can't even have the thought of even working for a day . what make me fall in love ? hmm probably a good conversation . the thing's a female says or talk about tells a lot about her . truck driver , you get an adventure and you don't have to listen to your boss yell at you :) i have a lot of friends , the problem with friends is that they will easily back stab you or leave you for a girl at the club . it's stupid thing's like that that tell me a lot about a person ... of course , should have said almost :p it's just that i saw a few threads and that's what made me think that . eh , i'm not into into's that much btw , welcome ! [ / quote ] beautifully written , so well detailed i thought i was there as i was reading . not a lot of stories make me feel like i'm in the exact place and yours did brilliantly , i could picture everything . send ... i agree money first then everything else will fall into place . you're absolutely right , i think everyone feels that way when it comes to their work . since you get 400-500 hits which is pretty impressive i would think that people would post a reply . but is it ... personally , i don't go out because i tend to get get out of hand . also i don't like the scene and watching how drunk and low people can get when under the influence . i use to go out a lot but never ... why would you do such a stupid thing ? of course you sound like an heartless , selfish piece of shit . focus on your career ? what career ? dude having a girlfriend and focusing on school / college / work ...
