' this is incredible : did this today with my band : :) i did things today , each thing is a different version of the same idea : piano thing : video : basically my ni tells me things , i rarely listen , get into stupid / funny / fun scenario . it's like a friend with a quiet voice trying to help , i'm just too busy to listen to it's kind objective thinking ... i dunno , i get very obvious when i like someone . i touch them , hover , smile , tell them awful jokes , and share stories . i generally only mess with people i think i have things in common with , physical ... got ya , not everything is fixable too . isfp or whatever else , some people are just a pain :p i love everything you mentioned , also sensors are amazing . intuitives all jealous while were out livinggg . all the sterotypes fit me , i doodle draw , write music , sing songs , goofy as all hell , ... intp vaux yesss these have been killing me lately . been following a page on facebook that posts the best ones from that day . i'd straight up tell him what you want . take him aside and have a talk with him about your issues , if he's a good boss he'll be happy to . try to make the talk very focused and to the point , without ... i'd just to listen to him , you don't have to tell them anything about yourself , just add to the conversation if it hits on something you know about or are interested in . getting out of your shell can ... my best friend and bass player in my band is intp . it's fun most of the time , i get us in stupid situations lol . 1 ) i live the things i love . i feel uncomfortable in uniforms and that kinda thing . 2 ) i'm pretty idealistic , but it's not crazy or anything . 3 ) depends , i'm not a painter . as a musician and ... been rocking the old skateboarder / hoodie life since 10 , not stopping till im dead . remember that surrounding yourself with creativity can fuel your own . creation is what life is about . well for me it is anyways . 12 + plus since invasion , isfps are scarce . flares have been largely ignored ... the thinkers are taking over ; is anyone still out there ? anyone ? ! damn thats a cold ass donkey ^ thats the hallmark of success though . working at whatever it is , all the time ; not because its work , but because you love it . i have to do whatever it is for myself , see the mistakes and learn from them . nothing else works for me as effectively as that does . thanks ! you gatta live in the moment as relish in it , its the isfp way ! :) i completely agree with everything he's said . i had a boss i worked with at mit who was a very strong fe user who loved to write . for me when i do write ( kinda uncommon to rare ) , for song lyrics or ... i'm really private , about everything . i just thought of something , what really helped me personally was trying to figure out the types of famous people ( trying too look them up in google for mbti type ) . then i just kinda looked at the ... yeah i dunno , i think that it the types should be stuck in a venn-diagram of some sort , based on how closely the functions are shared . but yeah , hopefully you get it figured out man ! thats not what p and j stand for anymore , from what ive read ( sorry not sources , don't hurt me ! ) all it serves as now is an axis-modifier . to say down with capitalism is silly . capitalism isn't the issue , the issue is allow companies to make stupid decisions all in the name of the bottom line . this isn't the place for the conversation i ... it's hard for me to explain but like if you think about it , its misleading that isfp and isfj are considered similar . they don't share the same functions at all and an isfp is nothing like an isfj ... in my opinion , the whole way these types are separated makes little sense to me . they should be separated by sharing the most common functions , that way a person can choose after identifying with ... well as an isfp i like to live my life creating or doing activities that expresses me . sometimes it takes me a long time to get out exactly what i want from my creations ( in my case music ) . i like to ... hm , agree to disagree then lol . if you have trouble using fe you are most likely not an infj imo . fair , in my opinion what makes life hard is finding what makes your insides fill up with warmth . it's incredibly hard , and some people take the easy route of slamming the round peg in the square hole ... i believe everyone has something to add , you have to find it embrace it and grow it . i used to suffer from this mentality a lot in my past . if you consistently defeat yourself you'll never win , in a ... some jazz : mouse on the keys - memory some post-hardcore screamo : rinoa - fires in the distant north try playing an instrument ( im bias'd lol ) , it hits me in all the right spots . stop cutting forests down . grow trees in farms and use those , cutting down forests is lazy and down right disrespectful . things live there . you gatta do everything your way or no way at all . a few choice pieces of recording gear , music is so expensive :( i can cook pretty well , i've never attempted a real traditional or fancy dish before though . i think i could cook anything fairly well though . the music i've recorded are created is in the sig . sounds oddly specific lol . don't let people sexually harass you , it's perfectly reasonable to cause a scene in that scenario imo . there's no beauty in art . ( wow that's painful to type ) indeed they are ! also i never crossed my mind that you would , so no worries there . funny that you mention him . i follow his channel and i gatta say he admittedly doesn't really understand what a true infj is . now he's on this whole weird god crusade and now claims he was possessed ... a true intellectual warrior you are lol . all of that is true though , online tests don't do anything except cause mass confusion . learn the functions and apply them , its basically the only way to ... infj , fe and fi confused me for a bit tbh . also my intuition is not at all that strong . common mistype though , i feel like everyone filters through intj or infj before figuring it out . joel and clementine from eternal sunshine remind me of that so hard ... love them . : laughing :: laughing : no ! you first !
