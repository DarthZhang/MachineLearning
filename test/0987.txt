oh my gosh xd they make funny stuff , i also enjoy watching jacksepticeye , julian smith , and gmm angelcat samexd probably because he's an enfp lol . the tenth was a slightly better actor , but the eleventh was a better doctor , if that makes sense lol . angelcat who's your favorite doctor ? no , but i love watching the ones by rhett and link i don't need spellcheck because i'm a stellar speller . trust me , everyone needs to vent to someone sometimes . not necessarily the person your mad at , just tell someone how you feel . bottling up feelings can be very unhealthy , and i've seen it turn ... morethanyouknow no need to be sorry ! but i like all of those bands too so thats cool ! when you are afraid of shooting someone down because you don't wanna hurt their feelings ... morethanyouknow good stuff ! do you like any alternative stuff ? like cage the elaphant , weezer , or blue october ? leictreon i'm an enfp and i approve this evaluation . if you could have any super power , what would it be ? be as creative as you like . what are your top 3 favorite tv shows ? ? ? in no particular order ( because some of us enfps are too indecisive for that ) . feel free to tell everyone why if you want to ! my favorite shows are : chuck ... i find someone i trust to keep everything i say a secret and then i vent for a while . that usually helps . also , if you're depressed , get off your butt and do something fun ! do not sit around and ... you've disturbed the natural order ... the one about the future is sooo true !
