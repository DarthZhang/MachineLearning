' i can very much relate . in fact i'm in the midst of leading towards very concrete , life-changing decisions and quite frankly , its freaking the shit out of me . every day i switch off between ... definitely ! i warn people not to . its deceiving because i may be laughing but soon as i get a free second you are getting kicked , slapped scratched etc . whatever it takes to get you off . ... i hate unrequited love ! maybe its hot from a distance . but i dunno , when that infatuated , mesmerized side comes out in me i just want it to end ! ( or for that person to fall madly in love with me ... well , i do love you guys ! but i dunno if i'm gutsy enough to meet people in real life :/ but for others who are comfortable with this idea go for it ! yes . yes yes yes . very similar story . i went through some hard times in my early teens . i grew up thinking i was this shy little timid introvert and then over time this crazy , energetic , monster ... really skinny guys . no idea why , maybe i like the boyish look ? only in a non-creepy way :/ also long eyelashes . sigh . and eyes . blue or green literally makes me faint . one thing i always loved ... hahah yes . i concur with all above statements . the cycle for me usually goes like this , walking down the street , observe surroundings , daydream about what i observe , suddenly become aware that i am ... i have definitely been told my standards are high , but i don't know how to lower them . it just feels unnatural . i've just come to terms with it . as long as they are not unrealistically high what's ... i was trying to pitch this guy to sponsor a child for this charity i was working for ... i asked him what he does . his response , so , i do nude portraits of my lady friends . then he continued to show ... i love secondhand stores . they carry awesome styles , not just whats in at the time . most of my favorite items were secondhand . just wash it and who cares ? what you dont know wont hurt you : wink : ... hahah , yeah thats enfp for you . i had the same issue with piano . when i started guitar i told my friend that she should smack me if i get bored ! a good way to keep it interesting is keep learning new ... i buy mostly vintage things . anything i wear must reflect who i am . i get uncomfortable wearing something that isn't me . almost like i'm faking . also a lot of my clothing has very out-there looks ... sanguine phlematic . yay for being well balanced ! thanks for posting : laughing : introspective / nostalgic : short version : i love this song ! i love trance , ... deadmau 5 is cool . ive seen him live a buncha times . always fun xd heres my list , nostalgic / bittersweet good luck ! ! i started teaching myself this past summer . guitar is the best outlet ever , i regret not discovering that earlier . yes and yes : crazy : all you gotta do is pick up a guitar and learn to play some iron & wine songs . it's addictive . i promise . : wink : i suppose that makes sense . i often need time to really dissect and place my emotions . it really doesnt come easy for us enfps ! but at the same time we need to understand them . hence introverted ... so , as enfp i am aware that we are the most introverted of all the extroverted types . i have gone through many phases of introversion to the point that i was knows as ' the shy girl ' . this was years ... hahah my thoughts exactly ! hmm , i often get so involved with the stories in my head that ill actually talk out loud to an imaginary person / make facial expressions reacting to my made up ... hehehehe yeah , thats what i thought : wink : this explains a lot . so good at pulling people in and making them feel sorry for you too . its sick . oh and theyre amazing lovers ... damn you infp's ! so why do you hate us yet linger around in an enfp question huh ? ! its a love so strong that youre scared to express , so you define it as hate . yeah , you know the truth drew ... i know ! it just makes me sad , i feel a strong connection to anything in nature generally so id say thats probably why . hahah yeahhh noo thanksfully i am not a misanthropic freak : crazy : no i never kill insects . nor do i let people in my presence ... in a worst case scenario i'll get a plate and a cup and transport them outside . yes , i know ... many people have made fun of me for it ... i am an enfp and i am currently posting my 50th post : crazy : many more to come ! ! i actually had a situation like this with an infp . i found out from a friend that he liked me , but when i next saw him he was too shy to even approach me . i found it adorable to be honest , but ... woohooo ! ! ! good job : laughing : quality time ( though that should be a given ) physical touch . agreed . its pretty damn important . and words of affirmation are always nice : happy : as long as they arent fake that is . ahhh i ... i would definitely consider myself a non conformist . ever since i was a kid something about becoming one among the masses just freaked the shiz outta me . i admire individuality a lot . i almost ... agreed , with everyone really . i guess i used to trust way too much and that got me hurt . so now ( at 21 also ) i just dont trust . though i feel i need a balance . thats probably my main concern and ... haha what can i say im no good at doing the whole non enfp thing .. which is fine with me considering how awesome we are : tongue : enfp is me . its a big part of who i am , what ive done . how can i not love it ? ! because of it ive learnt so many things and honestly we have the most fun anyways so who cares ! ! sometimes though it ... definitely unimaginative . more immoral . boring . conventional ... a world without nfs in general ? whooo i imagine that to be like 1984 status : shocked : scarryyy stuff right that makes sense , and i am noticing a lot of people share this issue ... but from what ive read enfps are often described as overly gushy with love , needy etc ... maybe its a misconception because ... yes , thats what i've been hearing a lot lately . problem is i don't know a single infj : sad : . oh well , his ni should help him find me : tongue : its true : sad : i had one close infj female friend , i have yet to meet a male infj ... where are all of you ? ! ? come to brooklyn and be friends with this enfp : tongue : enfps rock because we have a euphoric childlike energy towards everything yet a mature and deep insight . all rolled up into one ... how is that not awesome ! ? : tongue : i'm an enfp and i wish i could find a machine that could take in all my ideas and generate them into reality . hmm , some people here have gotten seriously of the topic ! thats against the topic thread rules . not cool . ps . that was my non enfp and obviously do not reflect my own views ... heheh i cant go non ... hmmm definitely an interesting theory but heres my experience with an infp . we had a very strong connection , definitely beyond anything ive experienced before , and our shared nf functions enabled us ... same here tine , its not even so much that i have done that , at least not in a longg time . i just knew if i shared my feelings it would be received like that , the trick is really to find someone that ... that is me ! i am always getting lost : unsure : its frustrating but honestly worth all the revelations , thoughts , stores etc . i had playing in my head at the time . i always wish i could go into other peoples heads and see whats going on ! sometimes i'm really just so curious to know how other people think ... i feel almost trapped into one train of mind . you ... i feel ya . i very frequently don't feel i fit into this society , or more apropriately don't agree with its ' standards ' . way too superficial for my liking . way too immoral . peoples views are so ... hmmm , gem stones . like jade and amethyst etc / random stones ive found on various journeys . random trinkets from different countries .. i have an abundant amount of useless crap from different ... hmm well thank you i really hope thats the case ! i had begun to think i was a lost cause : crying : heheh i just needa find myself a cute infj an ill be good : laughing : well yeah , id definitely say in my situation i also felt very strongly . i just couldn't express so well . or at all . which was ironic when the person would tell me they did not feel i actually had ... i want to know if any other enfps have experienced this . ive noticed a trend in my relationships that really affects them negatively . heres my conundrum ; on the inside , i am a hopeless romantic ...
