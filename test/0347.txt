what is me can't be you or can it ? you are embedded in my synapses i write the most brilliant poems on paper inside my head however , i always forget the teeny detail of submitting them or at the very least committing them to memory so i may submit them ... as if it mattered what others thought as if their gossip could actually cause physical harm as if each word of theirs spoken were the bang of a hammer against the nails of our own personal cross ... i like it . people have difficulty keeping perspective amid the chaos of the day to day . it's an exercise in mindfulness , and an eloquent one at that . oliver sacks is another one good at translating ... i find the truth to be vague : more a sense of things than any formal definition . the latter is closed where the truth is open : clumsy and laughing . the mud in the mud , he thought himself the mud , but he was anything but mud . had he done but a simple experiment only climbing out of and hosing off the mud , he'd have found himself to be ... mental constructs you spoke of setting boundaries and i laughed , not as a means of invalidating you , for every feeling you ever presented to me i thought a portion of your soul , a gift , but ... i spill my guts and dip my pen it is to you i pour my heart out i wish that you could see me . it's like i exist outside of your color spectrum . roygbiv black and white black on black can't you see ?
