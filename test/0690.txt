i'd say so / sx 9w1 * i hope not :) are you ? :/ i thought you were enfp once but since you have struck me as enfj :) also i notice your enfj avatar ! i love that she's enfj ! i am so sorry that i have criticized you in the past :) i did not realise i was :( any opinions on me ? ( i'm rather curious as to how i appear ) i feel like this sort of arises from being alone so much . i don't really tend to get into relationships for no reason , so i tend to be rather picky :) an ideal relationship would be a wonderful smart ... he's not completely to my taste , but his characters are very , interesting ! :) are we ? do you relate with this ? people tend to tell me i'm quite infj , and i'm 50:50 , which is rather funny , i feel if you're an infj you knowt wheras an enfj can be quite introverted at times and ... scientific , sympathetic , blithe , humorous , fairy :) . pardon ? :) this is the opposite for me .. when i watch tv programs i feel so much secondhand emotion i may cry . infp sounds very right , i get a huge amount of ni dominance from you :) they're all extremely beautiful ! i would be most likely to wear , the wave palette ! :) yes , definetely ! she almost has that ' fake it till you make it ' way about her , and is very talented and aware of it , but she does seem as though she is someone who uses many personas ! also , i ... lovely actress ! i thought i saw enfj in her but i could be wrong , she might operate on ni-fe though :) i've all of a sudden had a huge revelation about lea michele , and think that she could be an introvert , she seems to have that sort of forward image and friendliness that a very well adjusted ... any more opinions ? : o no , i understand :) i was just wondering what made it different so we could maybe decide . in terms of those types , i highly doubt she posesses fi , and that she is not an se dominant :) it's not off base :) thank you very much ! enfp and infp are the same functions but in different orders . in terms of if belle is an extrovert or an introvert , her being extremely unhappy with the life that she lives in the town , and wanting ... right , but why ? :) very true ! :) they also seem to interact more like entj and esfp rather than estj and esfp :) ni tends to take a lot of things and bring them together into fully fledged ideas .. i always thought tiana's view for her resturant was very ni , but i could also be wrong , i also think naveen is ... not at all ? she was always looking towards the future and using what was happening around her in order to propel herself towards the future she wished to achieve , of course her father was the guiding ... i always saw that at her using se-ni . she's comfortable with making plans and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan , but it is not as though she is content with her routine . surely she's an entj ? : o why ? :) oh well , you surely deserve to feel very proud of yourself :) you are an amazing human being , i really hope you're having an okay time :) you are so welcome ! she's a wonderful actress ! :) i think she's reserved , when she's on camera . even then , she isn't really so reserved , she's bubbly , and quiet but not necessarily completely energized by herself , she also was involved in shouting ... gatsby , surely operates on fe ? and lacks ti ? i'd say she was an esfj . :) hahaha , that's very true . i could see him as having dominant fe though , however . does he lack si ? i don't know , perhaps his planning could come out in things like his whole tirades against harry , ... isn't he an esfj ? :) she's also in elementary , and is absolutely great in that . yes , definetely ! well xnfj can be charming , enfj are called suave often , but it's in an extremely different way . she has that sort of se in the moment charm rather than that enfj , i feel for you and ... well it's the same functions but in a different order . in terms of just dominant functions , she doesn't really seem to be anything but a se dominant to me . she has all of these hobbies ( fencing ) , ... i think you absolutely nailed it on the head . :) his whole ' i shall make jokes , because they're funny to me ' is just so enfp . why not ? i am a massive fan ! :) she's not an enfj or an infj :) she strikes me as an estp . alright , i shall check those things out ! thank you :) thank you so much for replying , no that is not me :) that's lynda carter , who is extremely gorgeous i agree :) i was thinking it could be fe , sort of overexposure to feelings ? or something ? :) how would you like to be helped or comforted , as an estj ? :) dear reckless summer nights , we at the enfj forum , love you just the way you are completely . i am so happy you are finding a way to explain yourself , and help yourself line up with yourself . and ... for some reason when i'm down my self-esteem plummets , it's really unhealthy . i will be absolutely fine and have built myself up incredibly , but then i'll have a caffeine or a food crash or be over ... this way of transforming her emotions into dramatic symbolism and using this to communicate it with her fans strikes me as se-ti . i don't understand why tertiary fe , can't be strong ? while performing surely the main functions she will be using will be se and fe , which seems to suggest really realizing and connecting with her ... sorry :) i was trying to illustrate that we could take the things she said at face value .. :/ you have to keep in mind that , these things aren't always the same . she makes songs about john mayer and harry styles , because she seems to use writing as a way to express her feelings , which relates ... well you know my opinion on taylor :) se = ' you learn how to not have stage fright by getting up on stage 300 times in a row ' 5:15 ti = there are ... oh no , i was talking about a much cooler society , like the mega society , where you meet very cool people :) like professor x , and you can form a crime fighting team ! : kitteh :
