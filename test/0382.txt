' welcome ! my favorite type is intjs , you guys are just too adorable and weird ... and always find me odd for stating this . hope you ´ ll like it here :) ahh , the guilt that just all of a sudden appears and you just keep rolling in it * hugs * yes , it is just not in my nature to just let him sit there , while nobody invites him .. i just can ´ t . i ´ d rather having to put up with it , than spend more seconds watching him be sad ... i ´ m kind of ... haha , i do that too ! let me watch that titanic movie and get it over with . and if i don't , like allow myself to get emotional from time to time , it sort of builds up , and then out of the blue i ... i'm in nursing school . and we are always divided in study groups each semester . we have this very odd , man in his 40 ' s , from switzerland ( we are in denmark ) in our class . he is very intelligent and a ... hahahahaha ... laughing out loud when no one is around is strangely awkward . feel like the world most horrible mother . school started again and i ´ m exhausted , now it ´ s the weekend , and i should just be out doing stuff with my daughter , but i just need to be still and not do ... hooow can you not like pancakes ? how does that work ? just how ? ugh , now i want pancakes ... i found it to sound like so many other songs . but the lyrics are pretty , but not something that struck me . this i discovered along time ago . this ... it's not bad :) but i don't think i will like remember to look it up again . now i am not a p . but are you a parent ? if not , that might be somewhat more fulfilling for you than a partner and a job , which are just extras in my life after i had my daughter . haha , well , yes ... but my doctor said that i would be considered an hsp , since my sensitivity level are higher than normal ... but since it isn't the worst it can be ... its mild . i find it to make ... i got at smartphone for the first time like 8 months ago . i hate what it has done to me . now i make rules for myself . no phone while my daughter is at home and awake . and no phone at school as well . i enjoyed that , a very feel good song . and i kind of feel happy , but calm at the same time . sorry for blasting icelandic music on you , but there ... i was just wondering something . i have known for awhile that i ´ m a mild hsp ( highly sensitive person ) . for example , it really bothers me when i go from a lot of sun , to dark , and having to wait ... i ´ m sorry , i can ´ t handle hearing about dexter . that last episode was like having been in a relationship for 8 years , and then get dumped by text :( i want to take all the people home , feed them , put them to bed and run my finger through their hair , while saying it will all be alright . i ´ m either totally adorable or perhaps a closeted serial ... i lived with another , very energetic person in a very small apartment . you can kind of call it an apartment dorm , so there where like young fresh , happy people all around us . wanting to party all the ... my husband is an entj ( i ´ m starting to think a little between that and entp ) . and he ´ s a social worker ... no money in dat . i ´ m so sorry , i find other things than cats funny ... but it ´ s just ... cats ! : kitteh : well , i kind of like it , but it also annoys me . it ´ s sounds like my computer is lacking , and i dont do well with that . well i became an atheist when i was around 14 , so i barely remember how i saw things back then . i don ´ t know , i guess i just kind of followed it blindly . my church talked about homosexuality as sin , ... here goes ... 1 . i have read the harry potter books over 100 times , in english , icelandic and danish . and i ´ m reading them again . 2 . i had my daughter when i was 21 . which apparently makes me ... i don ´ t know if i get this sudden unexplained feeling . it ´ s more like when i ´ m around people , i can sense their mood / feelings right away , even though their action may imply otherwise . and this ... welcome , i ´ m new myself and have found this forum alarmingly addictive . i have never understood anime , so no points for me :( in danish it ´ s just pure feces . lort . they yell it all the time . crazy danish people . you might have seen this before . but it just makes me laugh every time i look at it . 92094 thank you so much for taking the time to answer . i have taken the test several times , and it comes out as infj , and once as an enfj . but i know that im an introvert , there is no doubt in my mind ... i don't think it is in my head , i read people and their emotions very well . i'm 5 ' 8 and stopped when i was 13 . they say women stop growing after they reach puberty / get their period . so at 21 , i don't think you'll be growing more . but i find myself jealous of shorter ... no , she is definitely not an intj . she has this very warm , and empathic present . and i believe most people find her easy to talk to . she does well in big crowds . but she'd prefer not to . and she is ... it would be very inconvenient if i were not , since it is in my profile name ( unless there is a magical admin around here ) . there has been some talk that some of us who claim to be infjers are in ... no i won't . i've been friends with intjs for so long . and i liiikem * crosses arms in a stubborn way * i have never met an intj that i would describe as a jerk . i find that word to harsh an simple to describe an intj . i have seen her twice . once in a public swimming pool and then again in a thrift store . i always have to mention that when ever she comes up . just can't help it . those are not easy questions mr . smileyface ! but i will do my best : 1 . my partner , and entj often misunderstands me . and friends and family do as well . not familiar with all of their types . ... oh yes ! nose hair ! how could i forget nooose hair ! i change my answer to nose hair . dear doris drew , i have had anxiety for a few years now . it's very irrational , and mostly is me somehow over analysing a little dumbness in a finger , that ends up with me having a panic attack ... now ... i hate feeling like i'm not able to help . just know that i'm sending you lots of warm thought . hope you're ok . uhh , i wish i was listing to this totally cool unknown band , but i'm not . so ... yes . it's katy perry , i'm listening to katy perry . and its the song roar . oh my good i'm so uncool and mainstream ... i don't know if any type is best ( though some are better than others ) . intjs are my personal favourite . i find them , funny , cute and interesting in a way they usually don't get : tongue : when you say sexy i have to agree with lips . lips are sexy . eyes are beautiful . it is a good guess but i don't think so . she is too good socially , and sorry to say , not smart enough ... even though she is smart :D first of all , i'm sorry that you feel this way . it is never easy . but before the sunrise , there is always darkness * hugs * . and second of all , i find it wonderful reading about all of you , and see how ... i find them very passive , at least the two of them ... and therefore not quite capable of deep conversation , at least not on my level anyway . and those short remarcs i've noticed . you ask them ... could i perhaps find another word for interesting ? * sigh * : blushed : '
