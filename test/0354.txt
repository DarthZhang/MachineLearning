hi , so i have a bit of situation i would like some advice on . in december i met this guy , he is about 2 years younger than me . he is a very sweet , happy and gentle person . our first date was really ... i love men that aren't afraid to be vulnerable . or better said : i love men that aren't afraid to show their vulnerability . we are all vulnerable , most people just cover it up with a lot of ... i don't think i ever consciously door-slammed anyone . i never really understood what people mean with that actually ? i have a tendency to stick to people way to long . even when they make me feel ... i would probably go for some very aggressive screamo . ;) but this one is relaxing and sweet : go home parrot , you're clearly drunk . happiness and peace for the entire world . if that's too much asked then just like notalone i could really use a pair of cozy socks . ;) i'm listening . how do i do that ? ;) yes this is annoying and exhausting . i want sex too . but i have to be strong haha i'll just end up getting hurt . : hampster : i obviously know that it's a lie . but if someone doesn't have the balls to be honest to himself , that is pretty sad . he pisses me off so much . i love it ... yes but why does he care ? he was always telling me how he didn't give a fuck about other people and their feelings . i want more . i dated an entp guy for a while . was all great and fun . after a little while he told me that he didn't want a longterm relationship right now , nothing serieus and that there were other girls . i had ... thank you for your optimist and motivational post . i would really like to be more like you . but i'm afraid i'm not and i'm afraid i'm not a hot piece of ass either haha . i do try to go out with a ... i'm from the netherlands . my guinea pigs . : octopus :   oops didn't mean for them to take up so ... for a long time i felt the same . at that point i became very depressed . i have always been there for the people dear to me ( and even for people i hardly know ) and for the first time in my life i ... you have to get your head out of the clouds . life is a bit boring , you have to try and find the beauty in it . you can daydream about being famous , amazing , rich or powerful all you want . but you ... i like to dress cutesy , i usually wear a dress . sometimes with a bit if a dark / alternative twist . i like to dress unique , authentic but without attracting attention . so nothing too crazy or unique . i think i'm somewhere in the middle of all three scales . i'd say that i'm more undersure but in other situation much more oversure . i'd say i'm careful but sometimes i really like to take a ... set realistic goals . if you shoot for the stars you will be disappointed , because you will never reach them ... make him feel comfortable and just ask him . i always feel encouraged to show my feelings when someone asks about them . good luck ! if you don't want him exactly the way he is right now , you have to let him go . people do not change , or at least you may never expect people to change . you seem to have trouble with quiet a fem ... i thought this was supposed to be a sarcastic treat ? not a place to talk about your sexual frustrations . ;) at your humble service my lord . your wish is my command . : octopus : hmm not today . aks me tomorrow , maybe you'll catch me in a better mood . : lovekitty : you guys are funny . stupid . but funny . ;) i tried that . no succes ;) i'd say a deer . or hello kitty . if that counts then definitely hello kitty . : hellokitty : : hellokitty : if i do get pregnant . i'll drop off the baby at your doorstep . : sleepytime : hello there . i'm very sorry to hear you are struggling right now . if you're body and mind are telling you , you need a break . then please take it . otherwise you will only end up overworking yourself ... hi darling . i really feel you . for a long time i felt exactly the same . at that point i became very depressed . i have always been there for the people dear to me ( and even for people i hardly know ) ... is that how babies are made ? you are most welcome . i feel flattered by your kind compliments . if i didn't know any better i would say you were flirting with me . if you could be a pingu√Øn or a strawberry , which would you be ? aah i love girly stuff . i really like the cutesy asian clothing style . unfortunately i am a tall european girl and i'm not petite at all . i would really ... haha not sure if joking or actually asking ? ;) yes exactly i don't even mind that he was seeing a million other girls . but he can't expect me to do everything the way he wants to . i think it's rude that he even't dared to ask that of me and i ... i don't really know what you mean by this . sorry english is not my first language . i ment to say was my last relationship was a huge disaster . so i wanted to just do some dating , until i was ... thank you for your beautiful and inspiring words . i guess i just sometimes get jealous of insensitive people . their lives seems to be so much more fur and easier . but i know that in the end you can't ... because i didn't want a relationship either and because we had fun together . ok so i always end up getting hurt and i'm starting to get really tired of it . rationally i know what i want and i try to keep my distance , but emotionally it just always seem to go wrong . half a ... darling don't worry . young men might go after the really beautiful girls . but once they get a bit older they will lower their standards or just realise personality is more important . by the time ... i do actually . :) i like to sculpt tiny imaginary creatures and i like to draw . : blushed :  i have heard the same thing . i never thought of the people saying that as narcissists though . i always saw it as my fault , being reserved and not just opening up about my problems . just because no ... i can really relate to this . i'm sincerely interested in other people and that causes me to ask a lot of questions and end up listening most of the time . i really enjoy listening but i also find it ... i feel lost too . but my friend , we are all lost . :)
