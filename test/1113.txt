' you herberigurgurher ' - i'm going to start using this now if i remember how to say it i don't know , i don't find any paticular type to be adorable . i can find certain people to be adorable but i really doubt it has much to do with their type . like if i were to say i found someone to ... that covered everything up then > . > i set them on fire and praise the sun while singing canticle of the sun that's why i give people nicknames , pet names make me cringe . i agree with those that suggest you learn about the cognitive functions . tests are really narrow and lead to predictable and mostly inaccurate results . also the descriptions for all types is going ... i'm very curious about a lot of things but i am rarely too lazy to learn about it , if it's interesting enough . it really depends on the situation , who i'm around and what the subject is . people think i'm really good at drums but i don't think i am that good , but i'll show off my japanese happily . i do chair acrobatics ( fidgeting ) i'm sure i'll be okay this place attracts different ( awesome ) type of people than those commonly fount on youtube . i don't really have to cope with it , i get called evil but harmless but i'm having a good time regardless so there isn't much to cope with . i have a nice middle ground i think , best of both worlds :P it quiets my thoughts completely , even enough to sleep . i don't think being explosively aggressive has anything to do with mbti and more so with other reasons . anyone can be explosively aggressive under certain situations . do you have any special hobbies you indulge in ? i play drums and bass guitar if that's interesting ? do you have any special interests ( something that has kept you interested for quite some time ) ? ... took me long enough to figure mine out but i was in a depressive stage for a few years which can effect how you look at things i write fast and type / write as i think it up in my head on what to say , so not much planning . but if i don't check things i often use wrong words or get my sentences back to front with bits taken out ...  this is like a bad acid trip sure , let's go estj-the supervisor you scored 75 i versus e , 80 n versus s , 80 f versus t , and 60 j versus p ! your ideal partner is known as the supervisor . as a romantic partner , this type communicates very ... vote for me isn't it impossible to suffer from sociopathy since the suffer couldn't care less ? or am i thinking of something different here ? besides i think entps just worry less about moralistic concerns ... i remove most of my body hair . but naturally i grow a medium amount but rather thick hair . i also voted on the wrong choice on the poll considering up to 600 different species of animals take part in homosexual activities with no purpose or beneficial outcome , i'd say natural . i really enjoy psychedelics , ketamin , speed and ecstasy . i have a big group of family and friends who are also into this , we just party most weekends which is the only time we take drugs . pirates of the caribbean nightmare before christmas ( and most other tim burton's stuff ) fear and loathing in las vegas the labyrinth human traffic can't quiet think of any others right now this is where i feel like the whole best decision is one that can be easily changed comes into play . my room has lots of bits laying around the place , but not too messy to not be able to move around in . the stuff laying around is stuff i use often , i see no point in putting them away properly if ... i've been around for quiet a while but don't post all too often no because i'd have to stop a lot of things i enjoy resetting the internet , use command prompt or contacting isp . or get a new ip which is even easier . i've been self teaching japanese for 2 + years this looks like an awesome thread for sharing materials i highly suggest you read ; table of contents / all japanese all the time dot com : how to ... no fun allowed or maybe a little .. it's inevitable well it's obvious why you lost . 1 . you didn't stab him 2 . it weren't a gun if i'm genuinely proud about something i will be loud and proud , because the chances are i worked bloody hard for it . i really dislike the loser is the winner mentality that society seems to be ... i'm not one for writing much but when i do write , i just write the same as how i speak . most of the writing i do though is in japanese because i'm learning it . ham , cheese , tomato in the biggest tiger-bread sandwich i could make stop caring about people who will never care and get on with your life . so , it's just like entjs drifting around in the void , occasionally bumping into each other ? i thought this was the dark side ? everything i know is becoming a lie again !
