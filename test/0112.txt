' exactly ! : cheers 2 : same here ! so curious . haha , ditto . the picture above is my male version of that . an ex of mine , who worked in the same office building as i did , once told me that when she would see me walking by , i looked like i ... lol , thanks . it's my most comfortable demeanor of choice , other than occasional goofball . haha ! noted , will be on the lookout , for random blackouts ! so very accurate . i am highly interested in engineering , but have 0 interest in the process to become one through undergraduate programs . have never met an istp female in the wild that i know of . but have always wondered what it would be like ! you might be smiling , but you can't hide the istp in your eyes . : wink : i'm so confused . is that you in your avi , or is that you in your gallery photos ? well , i don't mean to brag or anything ... but , you are most likely , probably , right . can i have the snow , aaan 70 degree weather ? that would be ideal ... lol haha , yeah , i keep it in check for sure . just a natural tendency to those ideas / urges . thankfully i don't mind being cold to random people , so it keeps me out of trouble . and of course , i love and ... exactly . though , i must admit ... : sad : it is still hard for me to control those thoughts , and i wish i could eradicate those urges all together . makes me feel guilty that i have such strong urges ... istp . my natural inclination is very promiscuous ... i see woman i am attracted to , whom i find to be visually appealing , and my natural instinct is to want to have sex with her . but , i expend a ... nice ! figured with a stomach like that . lol you look like you workout , is this true or false ? lol once when i was younger i had this . a mutually intense connection , that i learned a lot from , but that ultimately was a mistake . however , now , it is more of a gradual , logical decision to love ... she didn't . =) a few weeks later she was still there and had to wrestle some items from a man trying to run out of the store with them . i think they were somali refugees robbing the store . i found a wild istp female on the internet today : cute . posted this a few weeks ago in a different section : if i had to choose another type ... estp , or istj . try being an istp , and narcoleptic , at the same time ... now , take the never ending quest to find a fulfilling career for an istp , then limit it further with narcolepsy , and feeling like you ... yes , especially if the rule or boundary seems illogical to me . then , i want to push it , because it annoys me . exactly , i won't waste my time with a relationship , unless i see a future with the person . not about to expend energy on someone , unless it is an investment , and i have decided i like them enough to ... istp one is 100 % accurate for me . eerily accurate , actually . you win the internet for the day . treat yourself to a cookie , please . fitting and accurate . more so than the label perc has given us . lol , you have got to be kidding ... right ... i can't , for the life of me , understand how people can be so illogical and paranoid ... why do you get off on demonizing cops ? so , you are just angsty and looking for something to complain about , in relation to law enforcement ... i can't possibly imagine why you might have a hard time dealing with them ... when you can't ... interesting ... lol fyi , people who typically carry their wallets carry their ids on them ... i carry my id when i run , bike , etc ... also , if you are parked on private property , which includes ... i have lived in many cities with youth curfews . usually it's 11pm . hence asking for id to make sure they are not out past curfew . if they are , the officers just give the kids a ride home .  ... as frequent as they need to be ... are you somehow under the impression that if you never saw a police officer , or officers never questioned anyone , that we would live in a safer , more peaceful ... lies , and more lies ... all cops are jerks , who want to abuse their authority , and strong arm you ... did the cop arrest the op ? no , then the cop did not state they are a criminal ... they were merely checking things out , as is their job as law enforcement officers ... it is the fault ... or because it is their job to make sure the people are safe . i know many cops and border patrol agents , who have ended up busting really big drug or prostitution rings , because something about a car ... that's why he has been on my ignore list for ages . : love_heart : agreed ... getting pretty cringey at this point . we should start a club . this . the only issue i see , is his lack of respect for common areas ... which would be enough for me to find another roommate . this . if i must eat fast food , which is maybe once a year or so , then i prefer cfa . because they have completely different standards for franchisees ... mcdonalds requirements to open ... i thought it was just me ! ! ! i can't help it ! one of the first things i notice , good looking or really bad looking ... then internal dialogue starts up . came in to post exactly this ... lol or , if we give you the time of day , outside of instances of social requirements . was thinking the same exact thing ... sometimes i think about how cool it would be to be a female version of myself for a few days . but , that probably has less to do with being an istp , and more about being a pervy male . : kitteh : wrist injuries during final ftx in osut training at benning . same time period , torn meniscus . basically , our target escaped the building we were searching , and i jumped out of the 2nd story ... there are only two-three things that make me cry . really powerful songs , that have a lot of emotion . one such song was the christmas shoes . however , it was pretty much just the first time i ... haha ! ! : cheers 2 : agreed .
