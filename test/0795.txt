( 1 ) she is both extremely social and extremely not ( 2 ) she is very intelligent ( a ... no , i have neither . i am comfortable being weak . it's not as if it ruins my day . i weigh 160lbs . and stand at 6 ' 1 , people have been calling me weak for 10 years . i really don't know how to use a gun . guns are for stupid , racist rednecks with small dicks . i met some nra guys , that's exactly the kind of vibe they put off . and yes , i have seen some pretty ... try some bourbon with that popcorn , i'm drinking some right now . intp fe overload . shit , exfjs deal with this daily . yes , but i find it easy to just stop . might as well . my research has stalled , my love life never has existed ( hell , i don't know what it's like to ... empathize with me . i think that i am at constant odds with my idealized self , and the pressure i feel from my environment . surely you must know what that's like . idealized me likes love and ... i was going through linguistics and trying to formalize a field of linguistics in order to solve a problem in a . i . unfortunately it didn't work out . i spent a year of my own time trying to invent a ... i used to work on a . i . , then i realized it was impossible . i work on philosophy of mind , philosophy of science , and philosophy of language . but i think philosophy is killing me tbh . i like it , but i have nothing tangible to work with . i can't come up with ... why do people think i am trying stop myself by posting ? i think this is takes care of a lot of issues . i posted for the sake of posterity . maybe something interesting will be said by someone . i ... i don't rant at my friends . my friends are similar to me . why would i need to ? i am tired of having to demarcate people into the trustables and the others . remember , i am an intp , not an intj . i ... oddly enough i don't see myself as a victim . i just want to publish my work , be regarded as one of the great minds of my time , get married ( for stability purposes ) , and die . i can't seem to achieve ... i don't know , i think it's them . i am pretty fair and objective , and given their behavior it would seem that they have a problem with me . stupidity is something i dislike , but i really don't care ... i am lazy . and what is wrong with pussy ? actually lack there of is the reason why i am pretty much done . i really don't care about my gpa , i want to publish . i can't come up with much of anything to publish . can't , grad school seems out of reach due to my ( okay ) gpa . i am a b + student ( 3.3 average ) . even though i went to oxford for a while . is that not a fun way to go ? have you ever had bourbon ? you know what is really sad ? i can't even get people to drink with me . i ask constantly . so i drink alone now . i am pretty cold . unfortunately the one part of me that isn't is the part that is most looked down upon in american culture . you know , the whole love thing . i wish there were hookers around me . apparently in college girls go crazy and f * ck everything that moves . i didn't get that memo . i could have been doing it for free . how do i tollerate stupidity ? it depends , i am easier going with women , but much more aggressive with men . i am smarter than everyone around me . to give you an example . i once had an argument with my cornell educated philosophy ... but i am bad with guns , and besides , i want to leave a pretty ( er ) corpse . that is plausible , but i would like to suggest that i am not actually on the internet all that often . in fact i should spend more time online as there are more people similar to me . i decided to just drink myself to death . i crave physical contact with the opposite sex and i go months ( years at times ) without it . my research has stalled out completely . people hate me . i go ... well today i found out she died no way is she ( or jennifer lawrence ) and enfp . enfps are kind of d * ckish and closed off ( fi is inward focused , and personal ) . enfjs are more similar to se-doms who are very intense , focused and ... sorry , that was autocorrect on my iphone ; i hate ios 8 ( and yet i helped develop it ) . , she defiantly does not have a boyfriend . in fact , i don't think she does much with opposite sex . i'm not worried about being friend zoned per se . i am worried she had friend zoned me already and as a result will interpret a attempt to change the status quo as an attempt by me to ask her out . i ... i was at breakfast a few weeks ago in a dining hall on my campus and a girl who must be an enfj ( she acts a lot like jennifer lawrence ) wanted to sit with me ( i didn't know her , she was sitting by ... i just saw her again tuesday , and i got a really strong ti vibe from her . she was just acting awkward like a intp . she is co-president of one of the clubs i am a member of . her bff and co-president ... i can't believe i forgot this . she really likes her pet dog . her dog is like poodle , or malteese , or something . basically it's small and white . but , she really likes her dog . hey , i like a senior at my university . but i do not know what type she is . she agrees with me about most things so we are somewhat similar . in the interest of time i suppose i will just start listing ... bump i believe rick sanchez from rick and morty is the best example of an entp character on television . rick is a deranged , amoral , genius scientist with a biting sarcastic streak . what do you guys and ... i am very attracted to a girl at my university . she states that she is a enfj , but i disagree . i thought for sure extj . she is perhaps the most driven person i have ever encountered . she ... i live in a overly social part of the usa . people seem to only be interested in their immediate group . i was just reading in psychology today about fomo , and i thought that it accurately described something i experience on a day-to-day basis . for instance , no one wants to go out to the bars with me ... but would that be the majority of college students , or a sliver of spoiled business students attempting to look cool around their friends who are also a member of the set of business students ... so basically my crisis is a product of becoming too reliant on other people for my own happiness . they were able to make me miserable which freaked me out . i couldn't figure out why i was so unhappy ... ah , i just asked a clinical psyc grad student that i sometimes talk to . i am avoidant . i have avoidant personality disorder . i looked into it and yes , the symptoms fit me like a slipper . i seem to ...
