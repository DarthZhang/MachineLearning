can you change my name to intjake in quotes : intjake thanks ! you sound like an esfj to me . very strong fe , most likely you're si-ne under that . after reading this : i'm leaning much more towards intj . i think the questions in the functions test ... thanks , my answers do tend to lean towards i , n , t , j . but when it comes to functions , my te , ni , ti are all close / equal , with ne usually one notch lower ... i got this today on the similarminds ... took 2 tests , conflicting results : slight ( 9 % ) intp on humanmetrics but an intj ( 60 % j ) on 16personalities such a pain , they both fit . then again , my mood is in a lull so i could see how i ... that's what bugs me . if i'm an intp then why is my ni-te so high . and if i'm an intj , why is my ti-ne so high ? either way , it makes sense that i have a low fe , and a low se . it also makes sense ... to add onto what i said yesterday , i'd think it is most rational for me to conclude between : normal intj intj in ni-fi loop normal intp intp in ti-si loop entj altered by few social experiences ... thanks , that's the same i thought the results said . but , i'm wondering why i have so many little things about me that aren't very intj-ish . here are some things that have made me doubt if i'm an ... not sure if you saw but i took it earlier . took it again now , since i'm in a better mood and much much more awake - extraverted sensing ( se ) * * * ( 17.9 ) limited use ... i took it today . i am a little more tired than normal , i hope that didn't affect it : se - 18.6 - limited use si - 27.5 - average use ne - 37.8 - excellent use ni - 40.9 - excellent use te - ... sorry i haven't gotten back to you , been busy . i'll try the test and post the results here in the evening you definitely use ti-dom and fe-inferior , so an ixtp . i didn't see much of an n / s standing out , but if apple said istp that very well could be right . * edit * - yep definitely an istp i read more . which answers specifically show each functions ? i do relate to the intj profile ... but sometimes other profiles stick out . specifically the other 3 nt types . i've become much more confident im an intj . i feel like my introversion has shifted from ... i do agree with most of what the intj profile says about me . the problem is , sometimes i feel in , say an entp , intp , or entj mood and i just don't understand why i flip so much . sometimes i feel ... firstly , i'll start off by saying i have normally types as an intj on many online tests , 16personalities , celebritytypes , and at least 3-5 others . i have scored pretty high on n and t ( never below ... you did come across as an st to me . i like it and i've used it for helpful things . i don't buy premium though . intj-male most-enfj , enfp , infp , isfp , entp least-estj , entj , esfp i naturally am a big-picture person and the ni description describes me nearly perfectly . however , i am very attentive to details , i have a strong memory of the past and often know facts even if ... hey thanks for the input , although i'm sure i'm an intj with developed si from an estj and isfj parents . if i was an istj , why do i get about 80 % on ni on functions tests , but still about 60 % on si ? to make sure , i took it again today , 83 % ni and 61 % si . cognitive functions expect you to always have one introverted and one extraverted , j / p and all that . i mean , it helps in typing , but no one breaks the mbti stereotype , people can break the cognitive ... cognitive functions give awful stereotypes way too general too . mbti is always right . cognitive functions aren't and never take them as gospel . at best , cognitive functions can be used to help find someone's mbti type of 4 preferences / functions are a little weird and shouldn't be taken as gospel . only the 4 letters should . i'm pretty sure you're an si-ne and a ti-fe , so here are the possible types : isfj esfj intp entp thanks for replying . my best guess for now is an intj with a rare case of developed-si . this would only be possible because i have an isfj dad and an esxj mom . since i have been homeschooled and ... i've come to the conclusion that you're an fe / ti ti / fe user ( a tp or an fj ) . when it comes to intuition and sensation you haven't given us too much . how would you say that you personally process ... firstly , thank you so much for your help man , i really appreciate it . with intj vs . entj , when it comes to functions i'm an xntj . although , i read a few articles about entj vs intj and every time ... i do miss things in front of me ( sometimes , depends on mood , but it's very often ) . i often forget i'm in reality also . i have a hard time thinking abstractly with school concepts i'm forced to ... my dad is an isfj , so that would make sense as an influence . my mom is an esxx ( that's another story ) . i really don't have a hard time grasping any function , except for the fact that the ... it depends on what the environment is . i'm very cautious when it comes to trusting people , i expect most people to have an ulterior motive . but when it comes to exploring an idea , i'm not cautious ... i do have the qualities of ni - but the confusing part is i have some si qualities . inxj's supposedly have a ' hard time remembering details and just remember concepts ' , while i remember details , ... yes , i do experience that . i also play piano and when it comes to the notes , i picture them as ' things ' , but i can't explain them . like , i always get a certain impression from the note , and my ... ' you hurt my feelings ! ' maybe mine is critical ti ? intjs have that too . i think it's auxiliary ti . although i'm an intj and i do the same thing without ti . above i put in bold my comments thanks for taking time to help the definitions for these two functions keep changing ... whenever i read them on different websites . i was wondering if anyone had a quiz of ni vs si that they could post here and i could answer ? ... i definitely try to organize my world externally ( te ) , even if it hurts someone's feelings . i have some convictions but they are always personal and not unifying ( fi ) . in addition to my esfj ... but i use te-fi i actually started reading about the whole mbti thing before i knew there was such a thing as a ' bias ' . my first test ever , i typed as an intj . i am positive of it as well . my ti is not used often , ... i'll go by tiers tier 5 - the epic , awesome , best ( imo of course ): intj , intp , entp , istp tier 4 - a bit more annoying sometimes but usually chill : infj , entj , istj , esfj tier 3 - average peeps : ... also wanted to say that you esfjs are really great . i know we're three letters apart but i somehow connect really well . thanks .
