' i'm very confused about your position . you constantly attack studies under evolution using uninformed opinions . most of these problems have already been explanation if you read them . if you ... obviously science can't proof . when scientists use that word informally , it means very conclusive evidence . btw : creator conflicts abiogenesis not evolution . unless you mean a creator created ... first of all , science by definition cannot prove . i will from this point forth assume you mean convincing evidence when you say prove . it's unreasonable to expect science to prove any historical ... i thought everyone does that . i for one absolutely enjoy it . if that's not convincing ( i assume you know the science behind it too ) then you probably don't trust anything that you haven't seen then too ( e . g . history books , fossil records , etc ) . otherwise you ... did we see god create the universe ? is our observation even reliable ? you are touching things outside of the scientific axiom . if you want the answer to if birds grew wings , please do research the ... so you think a great proportion of emotions come from a non-physical source ? what might that be ? ok ... it's a bad habit i got into since childhood . too many let downs , why bother ? mutation is a driver of evolution . there is no narrow parameter in which mutation can only occur . there is simply a probability associated with magnitude of change . tracing back , our evolutionary ... where is the proper 7 ? you 7 kills you 4 . how did you 7 travel back in time without the existence of you 4 ? the fact that you travelled back in time becomes logically impossible from both your perspective and the perspective ... i'm not trying to force my opinion on others . i couldn't care less what they do . i simply desire reasonable explanations for my own intellectual curiosity . if you can't provide that , i won't mind . ... considering you think it will kill your feeling mojo , i presume you see the truth in science . in this case you willingly embrace ignorance to not get hurt , interesting , but not something i can ... if you do anything that prevents the 7th year you to time travel in that precise instant , you have created a paradox . a paradox by definition cannot ' exist ' and the universe will alter probability to ... what ? ... so you are claiming that generally emotions are controlled by a physical mechanism except you ? ... what ? ... what ? ... what circumstance ? i'm pretty sure the claim that you denied implied a general rule , i did not specify a circumstance . time wont tell you anything unless you do something with that time ... there is nothing stopping you from going back in time to change an event which is not in direct violation of your own observation . e . g . - if your left arm gets cut off , going back in time will not ... i find it strange for you to outright deny association between feelings and brain function , yet at the same time claim reasonable . why don't you believe a physical basis for emotion ? there are ... 5288252883 two scenarios : 1 . you go back in time . 2 . you rearrange matter / energy / everything and reverse entropy on our universe to mimic the past . this is practically omnipotence . in scenario 1 , going ... i wonder if your emotions / feelings have anything to do with neurotransmitters and different brain compartment's structure . e . g . amygdala and fear . hmm , better read some of that . funny how that's exactly what values and emotions do too ! except in the case of emotions , you are doing it unconsciously . believe it or not , statistics is far more reliable in an objective sense than ... when i discovered the critical thinking / philosophy forums , 80 % of it was filled with the crow's delusions . so i took 2 weeks out and constantly debated / taught him how critical thinking actually ... yep . and you aren't doing anything to time .. just spending a lot of energy to rearrange space and somehow reverse the effect of entropy . where did this energy come from ? i don't know . there are ... he got banned for raging too much . yes it will . because the normal concept does not require reconstruction ( i . e . reverse entropy change ) of the universe . you might want to read some newer neuroscience / psychology papers . the crow . the dude with a crow as his avatar and was named the crow . i highly doubt he was enfp . i didn't take it seriously at all . i don't argue seriously until someone proves to be a worthy opponent . i tend to also leave minor errors occasionally in my reasoning to allow for rebuttal ... claiming that you know the precise , objective definition of a word is insulting to epistemology . this is a direct violation to the scientific approach to knowledge and hence hypocrisy . if ... all sciences are derived from philosophy . the whole point of science is to find the truth . it makes assumptions that there is an objective truth , a physical reality and that observations are ... what is the objective of science ? what is the objective of law ? both have a predefined essence ( axiom ) and was rationally built on from that . science is not the practice of questioning ... i know law obviously means i know the guidelines / rules / structure of the law system . it doesn't mean i have omniscience in everything law aims to explain . likewise i know science means i know how ... does the same principle exclude me from saying i know law because i have yet to review all cases and implications of law ? well science ( as in the scientific method / axiom , i . e . the definition of science these days ) actually doesn't change nor question itself ... if i said i know how the universe works ! , then that's ... but ... i know science ! so you propose that time travel is more like rearranging all the atoms / energy / everything back into what they were n years ago with the only difference being you exist as your now relatively future ... the only reason you think that is because actions are easier to interpret . in reality , the combination of everything you say , do , think , etc , define you . what is there to gain from ruling the world ? intjs don't waste time talking to people they don't want to talk to . if it was a change of opinion , you would simply be ignored or avoided . if i did what he is doing , it's obviously a social ... you are correct , which is why i said that discussion would be meaningless . it was only to serve as a simple analogy to show distinction to what he thought i said and what i actually said . and if you manage to list out what that food is with a few supporting arguments we could have a proper discussion . although for the food example , i don't think it will be too meaningful . the same ... the lich there is a difference between : do you know a food that taste better than chocolate ? if not , then don't complain about chocolate . and chocolate is the best food . do you need to be an expert in physics to get 100 % in a high school physics test ? your link is completely irrelevant to the discussion . no . when did i say that ? you have even not justified why the problem is even a problem ( objectively ) . that just makes it double as pointless , because now you are asking for an infeasible change which potentially isn't even ... how will you achieve that ? do you have a better suggestion ? as much as everything being not perfect , i do not believe people have the rights to complain if a better alternative does not exist . no , but you need to be slightly realistic . people need to eat ( among other things ) to survive , and being good at procrastinating or anything else that doesn't offer society this need is not required ...
