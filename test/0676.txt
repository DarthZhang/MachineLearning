i've been diagnosed as having severe depression two years back ( 76 on zung's scale ) and i know how hard is it to get out of this state . but , i've managed to get out of ... i have two real friends that stood the test of time ( 10 + years ) and they are intj and intp ( both tested ) . you are right . i try to keep it like that even when the odds are against me . thank you :-) there's a fair chance that someone will listen and like your stuff . if that happens it's victory for everyone . 452353 pinaattitonttu good thread ! i choose these three tracks that i've listened to intensively this year . they will forever remind me of this very year - year of severe emotional pain , discomfort and ... i enjoy all aspects of beer - the heightened mood , the cold glass filed with gold in your hand , the bitterness . these several day long binges are gone and i drink more deliberately last few years ... the colour seems to be blue and black and that means that the hair is most certainly unnatural . i'm sorry . i never went to college and i didn't finish high school either . lack of ambition , motivation and the fact that i was actually doing some money in the field made whole study thing unattractive . i've ... had most awesome day today . did all my errands and business , sorted some stuff that i've been neglecting in my infpish way and then we were outside with my daughter ( she's staying at my place for a ... yes . there are many things that document it nicely . lots of unfinished writings that i've lost interest in . perhaps most peculiar example are my software projects that i've started just for fun and ... i feel my full stomach . eating the traditional czech soup which consists mainly of pig blood can be a temporary burden . it's worth it though :-) trying to change opinion or stance of ignorant people is like smashing your head against the wall . i usually just shake my head and walk away when i see that it would require extra effort to achieve ... i've been complaining a lot my whole life . i never complain about my own stuff though - the main subject are mostly external things that somehow relate to me . i have this should be better / we can do ... blame distry . i'm sorry , i just simply couldn't resist . i fell in love with this song for some reason . it's bandcamp , just click & play . santa sangre | marriages i would date anyone . i refuse to judge before investigating . : wink : pinaattitonttu video not available :-( good old katatonia . oh my sweet nurse , pull the curtain aside for a while ... someone did quite cool video with drawings / lyrics for that song : so here is my awkward voice message . last sentence is in czech and just basically says have a nice day and my name / nick . vocaroo | voice message i've had it all . several years of major depression , social phobia , suicidal thoughts , generalized anxiety disorder , blah , blah , etc . my inner world was continuously crumbling for years , but since ... my memory is highly unreliable in overall , but winner would be definitely long term memory . short memory is my worst nightmare and i'm also forgetful ( very nice combination ) . i don't remember ... i can relate . i straighten stuff randomly sometimes too .  ... i didn't say the most important thing before though , i'm partly compensating for last 10 years that i've spent with my messy ex . it ... i'm not messy at all . partly because i'm terrible minimalist and also because i really need space to breathe . i keep everything tidy . then again , i'm really in the middle between infp / infj . i'm 30 , although people mostly say that i look somewhat younger . my mother is 50 and when we are outside together some people tend to think that she's my wife , due to her young look . there's ... i wholeheartedly recommend new widek . it's spacey djent / ambient / progressive / whatever awesomeness . pretty much what has been said already . i observe for a bit and then fully commit , the bit is usually rather short though . so the real answer is yes , i fall and commit to a partner easily . i consider the girl's height to be totally unimportant . my partners were always smaller , even though i'm average height 184/6 ' 0 . i would totally not mind if the girl was higher than me either . that reminds me of my little fishing mission . i was around 7 or so when we were near this pond where my uncle had a small cottage . i was fishing over the day with him and everything was cool and ... arzazar szubrasznikarazar some awesome stuff right there !
