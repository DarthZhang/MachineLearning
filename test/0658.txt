' ha . same thing happened to me in high school in art class . based on all my grades on the assignments i deserved an a , but he gave me a d because no matter what happens , [ he ] has the final say on ... what . did . i . tell . you ? that is all . so are there any kind , nurturing , submissive intj women that anybody knows about ? or are they all defensive , aggressive , and cold as you say ? i would like to change my name to ashitaka . it suits my avatar better :) what are some of the major differences ( if any ) ? as long as you're gonna end up in a job that lets you get by , my recommendation is to not worry about the money and do what you're passionate about . even if you do just care about money , you'll ... i'm very surprised . the fact that he held you closer is a dead give-away . there's no way i would ever do that with somebody i wasn't interested in . now , it could be that this guy has women falling ... is it possible to change your username ? how ? that's interesting . i would think a classic intj response would be something like : what did she look like ? a foot . would you have done her ? if you like feet , sure . no they haven't ! ! i've barely heard any good things about being an introvert . ugh . i wish i could change my op . clearly , nobody understands what i'm looking for . my op was meant as a ... intj's primary modes being ni & te - - same as entj . why would entj be any different ? link me an article describing this . i've never heard this before , and it's very hard to believe . uh ... no it's not . it's least susceptible to i / e . intj = ni te ( fi se ) entj = te ni ( se fi ) istj = si te ( fi ne ) infj = ni fe ( ti se ) intp = ti ne ( si fe ) well , i've outlined quite a few advantages of e over i . i think the impact is fairly significant . though , you do make a good point about less drama . well , actually , everything else being ... getting back to the op , i'd still like to know what the advantages of i over e are . well said wikisurfer uh ... what ? this was just meant to be an analysis of e vs . i . i personally think e is better . if i was entj , i'd probably think the same thing . the only difference is i'd be responding to your ... oh . yea . nevermind . we're not doing stuff on the same level at all . what kind of oscillators / filters ? software or hardware ? are you doing any of that design ? or just using cots stuff ? agree . does nobody know about rome ? i remind myself that hey , at least i wasn't born in like 2050 or something . i can't imagine how bad things will be by then . all i can say is i hope you and i ... both ? how can you do both ? you must work for a - really - small company . and yea , everything's moving to software . hardware guys are gonna be obsolete in not too long ( except for the soc stuff ) . oh really ? software or electrical ? i'm a firmware engineer , and i do some dsp stuff myself ( for power metrics ) . an interesting study i found shows the likelihood of being intelligent : intuition = 58.4 % of which are gifted introversion = 46.4 % of which are gifted perceiving = 45.2 % of which are gifted ... ok , great . what are the pros / cons ? i completely agree here , and the capacity may even be unlimited . uh ... no . this is no more darwinism than choosing a career path is . best . song . ever . i think intjs probably take it to the extreme . either completely ignore their health or really work at it . last time i got a complete health screen done ( with blood work up and everything ) , i ... i question this . if you're truly an enfp , you'll be over this whole thing in a few weeks , in my experience . could not agree more . i'm actually going to try avoiding infps for a while , honestly . that's a very good point . thanks . i , personally , have always known myself better than most people i meet know themselves . a japanese friend gave me the nickname kisho , which means one who knows ... i think success is determined by happiness . according to this study , happiness is determined mainly by health , wealth , marriage , and education ( as well as gop status and church ) . and except for ... could not agree more . i can see this . why is this a good thing ? i'm not sure this is true . maybe generally . i've met many exceptions . i'm surprised nobody has poked holes in this . darwinism is about genetic evolution . mbti is not tied to genes . two es can have an i . i think you mean everything else being equal , introverts / extroverts are equally capable of learning the same amounts of knowledge right ? in theory , degree of intelligence begets capacity for ... no , i was just referring to infinitia : laughing : that's why i'm here . to make you lol . sometimes i'll even make you rofl . yes , i understand what you're saying , and that's what i took away from your previous response . sorry , if i said it was not profound . i wasn't meaning that as an insult . i've just heard it many ... so it seems like most people are either responding with a we're all god's creatures type responses ( or funny jokes , which is cool too ) , even though that's not the common poll answer . i guess ... citation please ? what i said was this poll shows some interesting correlations ... i'm simply presenting some of the more interesting data points that i've found . i'm not trying to make ... i've been giving this a lot of thought for a while now , and i want to get everyone's take on it . posit : extroversion > introversion work your charisma helps in getting a job or a ... well , it just so happens that i - do - have an opening for an enfp . if your current position doesn't work out , give us a call . i would move around a lot of them in 5-10 . for example : 6 , girl # 1 is quite attractive and deserves at least a 7 or 8 , imo . 9 , girl # 2 ( blonde in last row ) is really not that attractive to me ... aftershock listen to hoom . just tell him . be 100 % honest . keep it brief ( 3 sentences ) . give him time to think about it , if needed . as an intj , i don't ever seek short-term relationships . i'm always ... me = intj feeling = does not compute . uncertainty = does not compute . killer = does compute . primary : inverted triangle secondary : oval the square / rectangle ones look like dudes . probably . i'd day trade regardless , if it wouldn't bore me to death . no , what i mean is , the free market that liberatarians want . their ideal . how is that any different than the situation ... ok , so this is really what i should have quoted : and this is a valid argument ( not necessary entirely true though ) . however , it does make the assumption that people ( esp . those paying more ... agree . i was attempting to infer that with my statement . many gops are saying this . i don't see the connection . please explain . well , that's debatable , but irrelevant to this ... heh . that's what i meant when i used that term . i don't think he's cute . edit : sorry , i didn't see that you are french . when i said like i meant due to his political stance , not because he ... i would like one libertarian to explain to me what these increased opportunities are . businesses aren't charities . i like mitt romney . if i had to choose among the gop , i'd pick him .
