the door is closed . mum : ... niss does have a point . guilt , even if i'm not directly involved . but for me , i think guilt is the result of empathy . what happens if we did ? has she also got sp / sx and rcoen ? like what you did there . i'm confused by politics . i wouldn't vote because each party eventually runs our country to ruin . * looks back over the last 10 years of uk political history * imho for me , i would need space . someone trying to calm down me down makes it worst . it's fine . i forgot to post yesterday that it was fine when i got home from college last night . and the point in this ? i wasn't implying anything . oh and btw i'm fairly good at trivia . i can always enjoy a pub quiz . your american quiz show is reminding me of this old show : ... i don't know whether to thank that or say that's a low blow from you stephen , you should know better . yes and no . i know the stuff i go on about , seldom , because i am familiar with it , etc while others are not . yet they are able to talk about something that can fly over my head because i am not ... i know . tell me about it . that's her excuse , along with you're beautiful . last night , she was talking to my brother and was looking at me , i just don't understand how she can't turn her head to talk to him . 30783 rant : boiler packed up . playing a video game , i was thinking oooh , it's cold now . saw my mum said it was cold , she said yeah its cold . saw my dad , he asked me if i was cold , said yeah , he said ... noy-ee ? ? ? my mum does this annoying thing when she speaks to my brother , dad , or all three of us , she always addresses me . so she's sitting across the dinner table from me , and talking to my ... two more : actually ... i know i don't really care about it , tbh . i would just want to spend time with my so , i don't care how or what we do as long as we are together . my isfp friend , i've been moaning about recently , hates ... dear enfp , i don't mind hugs , i now will receive and give out hugs . i still don't think it is necessary every time you see someone . i do that to hurry someone up ; it's always fun but i won't be ... takk ( icelandic for thanks / thank you ) i can't . i need to go home . gah ! what are you doing ? ! edit : in my head - your ignorance annoys me ... i actually don't care ... move and remove ... dear isfp , you may think it is fine to be a bit late for lesson , even if you dislike art that much , but still , i think it is necessary to be on time . when i say i want to get a move on / we have x ... i get told that a lot , i do a half asked smile . i don't get it . / do you know what to do ? stop using such big words ! i don't understand them ! say another word about the time ... i think i'm back to my quick witted self . part of a conversation between me and my friend this morning : isfp friend : what bus did you get on ? me : the 16 silly :P next message sent 0800 ... gammon steak is nice . rave : got told i'm awesome and that i have a good sense of humour for some one in our group of friends that doesn't speak much compared to some who does a lot of talking . i get told to shut up when i'm complaining . but usually i keep it to myself , unless it drives me up the wall . i'm actually in love with this song right now . mbti enthusiast nearest book ; 101 things you need to know ... and some you don't ! that's a question .  ... insest ? ? ? o . o mood : indifferent , annoyed , yet calm . reason 1 : cheered up my isfp friend , whom was in a bit of bother . reason 2 : i have decided that i do not want to do creative media next year but networking ... i got told i mumbled today , by two different people in two different conversations . i also tried to explain why i like to go home and what i do when i get home ... they still consider it nothing ... hard work being best friends with an enfp , ( i am an istj ) , but its a laugh . our view points aren't always the same , and my explanations aren't always the best , so that doesn't help , but all in all , ... an observation that i have made about myself : it takes me longer to read a shorter novel than it does to reader a longer one . i love the original poem more . lego is amazing . i was thinking about a conversation i had earlier with the art technician , i was moaning about how i used to be ok at building stuff in 3d ... consider your self wrong . finished killing floor a few days ago . now i'm reading die trying by lee child . according to that it should be 1w9 instead of 9w1 ... that's probably right ... i seldom get sx for any of the types . what i worked out ( with a bit of help ) my enneagram tri-type is in my signature . i don't read the bible , own one ( got given one at the end of primary school , it's in the loft now , i think ) . to add to the nerdy-ness : me and my brother started making fun of pokemon attacks at dinner tonight . sam used no ! sam used point . it had no effect . sam used poke . adam is getting annoyed . sam ... i'm in the same position , but authority is necessary . i don't actually know ; my friends aren't interested in what i say about stuff i'm interested in because they don't understand / know what i'm going on about . i listen to them , but i don't really take ... i do this , i find it fun , some times with the stuff that they say . i reckon there's only one melancholy temperament , in a class of 26 ( including me , excluding tutors ) , and i'm that one . or it could be my really terrible typing abilities . i effectively gave up after question 5 ... question 15 was too easy . 7/20 btw . edit : i'll retake the test later , i only woke up an hour ago , and only had between 1 and 3 hours of broken sleep ... rave : christmas decorations are coming down ! ... rant : the decorations are half down . yes , i'm having the same problem with a novel i'm currently reading , it's going to take more than a few months to read it . the idea of the long post maybe good , but i get fed up as soon as i read ... finished reading i , sniper by stephen hunter a while ago , then read last pope by luis miguel rocha in 5 days , 3 days ago . now reading : killing floor by lee child . this sometimes becomes a problem for me ... when are you talkative ? when i know something about the topic of discussion . when in one on one situations i will talk a little more . when are you ... mood : annoyed reason : i can't remember what i typed out for some questions in a thread because i accidentally pressed back ( right click on the mouse ) . grrr ! adesi , kuropuu , and anyone else ; i just had to look up those numbers .
