' i don't not eat my own boogers . frontal images of airplanes . most intp's i know have a really wide music taste , take me for example , i listen to black metal , death metal , progressive rock , post rock , some classical rock , electronic / idm , ambient , jazz , hip ... i started talking in sentences when i was like 2-3 years old , and i learned how to read at 3-4 years old apparently . at least that's what my mom says . i used to go out every weekend for almost 10 years to get drunk and high , but then i stopped doing that and now i almost never leave my house anymore . i wish i had two monitors and a super speed computer . yeah , i'm pretty sure i'd end up convincing them not to buy it , if that was my job . not at all , i'm also not scared of going to the dentist or any other painful thing that most people are scared of . left probably , since i'm left footed . my legs are usually twisted in all kinds of ways , but i can't sit like that because i'm too tall , and my back is pretty shit . the internet . you should listen to deathspell omega and the ruins of beverast , unless you only like it grim and kvlt . finnish dm is absolutely the best thing in the world . i wouldn't really call myself a metalhead , but i've been listening to metal since i was 9 ( although not quite as much lately as i used to ) , but here's my last.fm if you want to see what i listen / have ... i'd love to have an armchair to sit in infront of my pc . stop telling me what to do . epik memers woman up , dick . i don't see any reason for someone to like me . sometimes i say funny things , maybe that's one . i don't know . well i've never lost a game of memory in my life , so ... 99 because i got bored at the 13th question , but i did one a few years ago and it was 130-140 , i don't remember exactly . i don't find it hard , because i don't do online quizzes . i like spring because everything is coming to life , and i like autumn because everything is dying . i can't be bothered reading her whole wikipedia article , but i like charles manson , if that helps . i probably wouldn't do anything , but if my life was depending on it , then i would probably do everything in the same sitting . i have a few estp friends ( at least i think that's what they are ) , they're pretty cool people , most of the time at least . when i want to think , i put on something relaxing , when i don't want to think , i put on something very complex so i have to analyze what's going on . why would an intp wear a suit , that's pretty stupid . that about sums it up for me , but i prefer asses over boobs , or maybe both are good , who knows . but maybe asses are still better . ich kann verstehe deutsch , aber meine sprache ist nicht so gut . i really like linguistics actually , i'm fluent in english and slovenian , i can understand serbo - croatian , german , spanish , italian ... i don't know , we stopped using those a few years ago . we already changed ours on sunday , because we're a more progressive country than the usa . i have over a hundred original cds at home and over 200 gb of downloaded music on my computer . but then again i don't live in usa so i can download whatever i want . grasshoppers , and pictures of airplanes from the front . nice blog . exhume to consume . then you were too sober . i mean , this entire post sounds like something i'd write to troll other people , so i don't know really . am i being trolled ? yeah but , i suppose you get that title if you're dealing with large quantities of drugs , not if you buy just enough to live a comfortable life . but you could be the guy in charge of the pack , so all you do is you give the drugs to some small dealers and they sell it for you . you could always be a drug dealer . what are you even talking about ? this isn't intps anonymous . thanks for reminding me about summoning , it's been a few years since i've last listened to them . edit : oh they actually released a new album last year , i hope it's not too shit . but he's portuguese . b-but jesus ' tod is so entrancing . which ones then ?
