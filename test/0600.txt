' yay ! i've finally found a perfect wallpaper ( or something ? ) for my facebook wall i plan to never change again ! ( yes , i am one of those vain people who match it with their profile picture ) ... i think that your frined had actually a cool thought . and i do not see this case in particular as gender related . yeah ... except that i want my doors to stay in place , thank you ! :) people are strange . - the doors there is no way i will ever reveal how my cave looks . i mean , even my friends are not quite welcome there . when somebody buys me a drink or two , i cannot help and assume that something is expected from me in return . quite an unpleasant feeling . so , i am not really sure what i'd do . yes , otherwise i might not want it later . :( oooh ! i can contribute something death of kurt cobain coral castle lampreys have always fascinated me . have you considered an istp as an opinion ? 6953469535 6953769538 anything that begins with that awkward moment when ... or anything with word creativity in it too much is too much . / that's about it . i actually had tears in my eyes from laughing ... until i realised what i spend my time on . D: you actually want to disgust everyone , right ? c : i reccomend you the hedgehog in the fog i would rather say that the lack of intelligence is a complete turn-off for me . also i do not think that sapiosexuality could exist on itself . i mean , ( i acknowledge it is quite cruel of me ) look ... apart from coach-potato , i'd like to be a blooming potatoe . because that's more like princess & stuff .. 65841 i never throw clothes out . i think it is more because of mentality and cultural background though . if they do not fit , they are given away to my younger cousins . if clothes are worn out , they ... it's not about area , it's about people around you . especially when you are all excited about something while everyone else is just no . although left , empty , dirty , almost collapsed houses are also ... on the rare occasion i do not control my dreams , they become true . i usually see some insignificant details if quite a big vent of my life . last year i dreamt that i am sitting in a car with some ... seriously ? i am suprised anyone could be bothered about that . why is dividing by 0 forbidden / impossible ? according to what you said i should dislike you . it is an enlighting moment for them , so i usually try to keep silent and accepting . i mean , the thought that they have discovered their mistakes by themselves makes bigger impact than someone ... i quite like garlics . that's it . it's that i do not feel interested in any topic enough to dare to state it as my interest . but that was really more like an excuse than anything else . i do not have confidence in my interests to define them as i am not particularly interested in anything so , today i wanted to improve my english speaking skills and , as my room is a mess and i am wearing a bathrobe over my clothes because it is rather cool there , picked a simple chat instead of video ... clean up your room and then you can continue sitting . you aren't doing anything anyways . :/ to spread the genes , yo ! i would be an invisible dragon . so i could stalk and do all the other cool things invisible creatures do . showin ' off my photo-editing skillz ^ ^ 51528 seriously ? i thought that i am the only one obsessed with this game : o i think that si is that function which lets me relive moments of my life just by looking at some old piece of paper ( or other shit ) from that specific moment . also , it could be another function , but ... when i feel enthusiastic . lock the door ? story of my life . and i suffer from that all the time . i fear rejection & being annoying if everyone would know the character flaws of a person at the moment they meet him / her , no one would ever become friends . during first days at school try to meet as much new people as possible and talk with them a little . show that you are nice to talk to and easily approachable . you should be in a good mood when ... what if i don't ? :D generally , no . but there are some bits and pieces that can entertain me :) ^ what he said 43096 this photo shows my cat's true soul in the best way possible : kitteh : .. you do not understand how one can go too deep into a topic if you want to talk to him , just meet him in person . at least i do not take text messages too seriously and have read in this forum that other intps also do not prefer this kind of communication .
