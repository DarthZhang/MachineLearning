i'm pretty sure alliances will band together . same stance i've had in a while . i'm not holding my breath waiting for people to learn . it isn't that uncommon , really . it could just as easily describe most or all people . its just a question of ... what if i told you i thought you were strange , not because you are an intp , but because of you as an individual ? because you should probably just deal with it . i know plenty of intps i like ... what do i have to gain by giving you an answer ? you paying cash up front ? and , accidentally , sudden advancement . from the first time you saw it ?
