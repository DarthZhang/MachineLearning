' welcome , and glad you decided to come back : 0 ) . thank you for sharing , i'm sure he was a wonderful little guy and will be greatly missed . i'm so very sorry : sad : . i lost a special feline friend as well , though this was several years ago . if you don't mind me asking , what was your dear friend's name ? sincere i was actually one of the people who mentioned that love is not complicated . i did not mean it in a literal sense , i meant it in terms of what appeared to be game playing on the part of the guy ... bolded : i agree completely . i know you can't just switch it off , if you are in love with him the way you say you are , then the trueness of love dictates that you can not . the things that i have bolded above are what give me ... : i can completely relate , really i can - i have been there . i have had unhealthy relationships , and fortunately , i am currently in a healthy one that i have been in for almost 15 years . the ... : i hate to say it , but it sounds like he is telling you exactly where he stands . simply because he had you meet his mom and others from his past does not mean he wants to be in a serious ... all of those things will change in time . and i can tell you , from my perspective , i think it's great that you know yourself , and you know right now is not the correct time for you to commit . some or ... i can't speak for other infjs either , but i've been in a committed relationship with an istj for almost 15 yrs . everyone is so different . perhaps you are commitment-phobic because you haven't met ... not a guy , but my two cents - you told him no pressure , hold true to that . regardless of personality type , if he is truly interested he will come back around . since it's really bothering you ... best to do it only if and when you are ready . you should never feel pressure to tattoo . if you like you skin tattoo free , i say enjoy it just the way it is . : wink : wait ... what happened to eve ? o . o i've heard this one used a lot . it's still cute though :o) i know this is an old post , but : : hahaha ... agreed . i have a few , and plan to get more . : i'm sorry , i'm not sure where you got this . i mean , even if we were to believe the experts that martin luther king , jr . and mahatma gandhi were infjs , in these two men alone we see ... and yet you continue to frequent this area of the forum . where is the logic in that ? i think it does .
