' ya i've come to learn that my best friend is actually just waiting for me to calm down instead of not standing up for himself or ignoring me . he'll respond when he knows i've had time to cool off ... ya i actually got the low self esteem thing right away . my really close guy friend is an isfp and had that problem for a really long time , which is why i dont run away from guys who have it , or feel ... ya no i haven't talked to him since i yelled at him for calling me a stalker . and i really dont think i could date him anymore . i just really want to be friends with him i think . how do you think ... oh wow i totally want to give him a hug too ! ! but i dont know why . well actually i mean he and i have very similar past problems , like awful fathers and moving around a ton . but his dad is also an ... thanks guys for the support ! ! to be fair and all , the sex thing was completely my idea . we were in a weird situation where we connected so fast like we'd known each other for years that i just was ... hahahahah sorry wmdistraction . it seemed insane to me too . i'm not really sure how to make it calmer than it was , it was pretty dramatic for me . maybe just have you ever fallen in love so ... you know i was too . but he was always talking about the future and what we'd do in it , which is weird for me because i wasn't even sure i liked him . and he really wanted to have deep conversations ... my sister and i had this problem for such a long time ( she's an infp ) but now we're best friends . my recommendation is simply to tell him all that you've said here . it'll be hard , but he can take ... ya be a little careful because we dont always know how we feel about people right away . and its difficult to ruin a perfectly good friendship , at least for me . i purposely dont date friends very ... i recently dated an enfp i'm pretty sure and ya the chemistry is amazing . so i think it can work out if both people are willing to work on things . i do think though that both are pretty powerful ... be completely honest about how they're making you feel . my best guy friend who is an istp is constantly just telling me to give him space or that i'm bossing people around too much etc . trust is a ... so i met this guy who i'm pretty sure is an enfp because well in certain ways he reminds me of my mom who's also an enfp . we met at a party and he was extremely charming and funny and i thought ... i said that ... and i'm a woman . it could just be me , and dont get me wrong i'm friends with a lot of people who actually arent confident , but i didn't know that when i met them . i was saying that ... how about your dad ? could she be and enfj ? i just have never really heard of the two types being close friends or something more before ... interesting question ... typically my best girl friends are either intj's or infj's . my best guy friends though are enfj's , enfp's , istp , and isfp . i also have to good girlfriends who are estp's as ... oh i'm totally gifts and acts of service . i always try to be more touchy feely or say nicer things . but i have to actually make myself plan for it i realize , it just is hard for me to talk about ... hmmm . i would look at your mom again . its very possible that she is a esfp , or an enfj . a lot of times p's can be pretty organized which is what people normally consider j's to be . in fact , j's are ... 1 ) no my dad is also a loser , to quote wicked queen ... 2 ) yes i am the oldest . oldest of full siblings , half siblings , step siblings and cousins . i think that the people around you definitely ... mmm totally agreed . except for of course like not cheating or being mean or lying or abuse . but i dont think anyone wants those in a relationship ... just because we're j's doesn't mean everyone ... last year i got a d in a really important class . the whole semester was hell to begin with and then i started failing one test after another . i got sick , a friend of mine died etc . i got into this ... ya its interesting . i love helping people and who doesn't want to help someone ? i do need to be wary in my relationships that i dont pick people who i only want because i need to fix them . your estj ... :) just wait i'm sure one will find you ! plus those that find you because they like the same hobbies would give you a better connection . my isfp guy friend and i met through music . female estj's are ... agreed . apart from ifp's , enfp's are also the easiest to talk to for me . my mom is one and she is one of my best friends who i can talk to about anything and one of my best guy friends is one too ... or ... it'll make you a better person . being around other estj's sometimes is very intimidating . they're so judging and organized and perfect , i should know i am one . but when i'm feeling down i ... attraction as in could have the best relationship with ? ? ? some personality relationship things in my opinion are just incorrect . i mean i dont know anyone who ends up marrying themselves . and i ... i feel like most of the time someone is telling us all the bad sides of our personality type . its a little exhausting after a while to explain the same things over and over again . i only skim over a ... hmmm interesting question ... well in terms of future predictions i try not to make any because i'm usually wrong . i think in relationships its really how you take it . if you're constantly ... oh change , yes i agree that it is a scary scary thing . i am an estj myself and so obviously change is not in anyone something i like . but i will tell you something i learned : as a child , my ... did you ever consider that maybe the more you act confident , the more confident you'll be ? for example , you fake being confident once and you make a new friend , or date someone out of that . then you ... oh man , sometimes i wish i could just grab all the estj's of the world and smack them on the head , myself included . i wish you had posted this in our forum , because you'd get a lot more responses ... i am an extrovert who has spent most of her life being depressed . i definitely get into those areas where i am having no fun and i feel like i'm going no where saying what's the point anyway ? what ... just to add onto that ... remember women love confidence in men . so even if you dont think you're good enough , just fake it . even if its just for a little while , most likely you will draw some ... yes agreed , lantern as usual :) i really dont hold a score board for favors done . if i hold any score board its for me doing favors over and over again for someone and then start to notice that ... i suppose it depends on your definition of cheating . in my opinion cheating is when you intentionally have sex with someone other than your partner or kiss them for a prolong period of time . i am not ... i gain energy from doing work yes . like if i dont have something to do i get sort of depressed and upset . it doesn't mean i dont like to relax from time to time , but i really do like getting things ... not like i'm an isfp or anything but i am super close with my friend , i'm really the one he tells are his personal stuff to , so i may be able to add in something . he and i became close immediately , ... pretty much anything such as paper work , bills , housework , etc . as long as it needs to be done and i want it to be done then i do it . i feel really compelled to get things done and get them done ... the idea behind the isfp being the best match is that they teach us to be less harsh and we teach them to stand up for themselves . not so we can walk all over them . most estj's marry n's ... because ... actually , my biggest problem with my isfp friend is that he doesnt stand up for himself ever . if i am upset about something he either ignores me or disappears . that's not really solving the problem ... in my experience my isfp best friend only dates esfj's . and then he has me and he actually opens up to me and is himself more around me than anyone else . so i would say those probably work the best ... yes the temper is really a problem . my isfp best friend and i went round and round in circles for 3 years messing with this . we would be fine and then he'd suddenly disappear and i would get worried ... this is very interesting . my sister is an infp , so i imagine i'll probably end up with a child who is one . the two of us , while we can get along occasionally , we just simply have a very difficult ... there arent as many estj men on here , but i can ask my estj guy friend if you would like ? ya that doesnt sound like one . try an entj ... they're about the same , but not controlling or critical . he also may be an introvert ... i move on . we live in the present not the past . so why waste time holding onto something , there's nothing you can do about it now . however , it may look like we hold a grudge and i will give you ... ya i agree . typically , we have a harder time with emotion , but if we trust you and you know us well we'll open up . my enfp mom is always telling me that i am an emotional person even if know one ... i would probably say that i've never encountered either . for the most part of my life , in my family i was definitely the bully , and in my friendships i was constantly the one getting everyone to do ... i think it depends on who you are talking with , and what the situation is . if i am talking to people i dont know very well , or in a situation where small talk or frivolous conversation is normal then ... ya i would have to agree about this . although i grew up in a house of all girls ( girls who just happen to be nfp's ) i still tend to get along with guys , and girls who are t's a lot better . there is ... hahaha its definitely not just you . i spent the good part of 4 years being extremely confused and hurt by my friend just because i quite honestly had no idea what he was thinking or feeling . he is so ...
