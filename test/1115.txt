' face to face > > > instant messaging > > phone conversation > texting > > > email . i fucking hate emailing people . i've been in an ldr for two years with an intp and i'm doing perfectly fine . we've been friends since i was 16 or 17 ( i'm currently 21 ) and i'm the one who initiated the relationship by telling him i ... ok so i think most of us can agree that he's got a shit ton of fi and i think based off his interviews and lyrics i wanna say ne since he said himself that his lyrics usually have nothing to do with ... ah makes sense . thanks for breaking it down . 7/10 . witty but it didn't make me lol . edit : it's a top . same rating though . sorry i thought i saw another display pic . really ? i think there's a pretty real suggestion that she's an * nfj . i could be wrong though . what makes you think otherwise ? your cognitive functions suggest a high likelihood of being an infj . you should fill out one of the questionnaires . i * tj . i lean slightly towards istj though . also , i'm allergic to cats . how is this group think ? for my decision i didn't even look at other responses and went with the evidence you placed yourself and i got the impression you sound quite like a sensor . test scores are ... when someone tells you a mutual friend is traveling and your train of thought goes traveling . bedouin . patriarchal nomad . mongolians . what's the capital of mongolia ? ulaanbaatar ! as happy as that would make me do you have evidence to support that claim ? i agree with you entirely . especially the thing about taylor swift . it completely baffles me that people think she's an anything but an sj . this situation has nothing to do with sensing or intuition . it has to do with being a pervert with a dash of stupidity , and i really don't know how many intuitives you know but there is no evidence ... i'm gonna bump up this thread in case anyone omes up with any other possibilties . i suspect a possibility i may be an * n * j as well ? or maybe an introvert ? i got a mirror for christmas , which i'm cool with . it means i get to admire myself even more . how old are you ? your answers sound very estp . ah , excellent point . i just think i'm naturally skeptical . when i type people i do go based off of what i perceive their functions are , but even then , i still think i have a lot to learn . if we're going on stereotypes then absolutely e / isfj , followed by infp . yes , i don't think it's impossible that intuitives are simply more interested in mbti than sensors , but the fact that nts are the second most popular types on here , and are considered the rarest ... no real reason really . i just like toffee . fill out one of the surveys and get back to us . you sound a lot like my mother who is an isfj . i can see how people think entj but most of what he does is based off of his personal morals and ideals . he's good at logistics and planning but i wouldn't call him logical . i'm gonna say he is ... i'm pretty sure my mom is an is * j . we get along for the most part and she's an overall great lady , but i seriously think we have completely different ways of thinking and it hinders our ... yes , i mean there is a very remote possibility that intuitives really do just like jungian theory and the mbti a lot more than sensors , and that's why we are so prevalent here , but if we were going ... i take back the part where i say i might be a mistyped sensor . we clearly think the same lol . i also think one of the reasons people have an anti-sensor bias is because of the way online descriptions of intuitives makes us out to seem like some enlightened , mystical , unique little snowflakes ... scuei ( 3.3 % of women ; 5.3 % of men ) not afraid of doing the wrong things , does not value rules and regulations , prefers unpredictable to organized , does not accomplish work on time , needs to ... taking a break from school was one of the best decisions i've ever made . i'm currently working at a ' respectable ' job at a law firm , and get paid pretty well considering i was inexperienced and i'm ... i would say you're an artistic and intelligent istp . also , tom ford , excellent designer and business man he is . sps in general do a lot of self reflection and use their past as inspiration to ... what the fuck was that for ? i'd probably take a few seconds to try to understand it . if you hit me again though , it's on . how old are you ? how well do you understand the cognitive functiosn behind the mbti ? none of your responses give any real indicator of anything either way . as a matter of fact , the direct straight to ... well , for me , my favorite classes are always very discussion oriented and where we learn by conversing . i've never had a college level class where we had game shows and party time , but i'd imagine ... fate : you've got excellent taste in music , friend . scorpion : welcome to the nt forum . i have an istj friend who is excellent at dance choreography . why can't an sp be a composor ? especially an isfp whose dominant function is fi , and who would probably make music whose heart is falling out , and their extroverted sensing would make them more ... i've highlighted your points that especially stuck out to me . i can appreciate pop and dance music . i'll dance to jay z and kanye west songs , but the songs that really make me feel are often ... i wouldn't go and say that . in all likelihood they may have been simply more talented and skilled sps . i'd even lean more toward nf than nt but i think it's hard to say what type they were based off ... judge me ! there are several ways to figure this out . when i was a kid , i used to be really insecure so i considered myself an introvert but lemme use a scenario that might help a bit . say you're ... well , i might take it more seriously if you explained why you've determined these dudes are their types . i have a really hard time believing any of them are nts . ^ ^ that lmao isfp just cause your type doesn't change as you age . you might have been a shy entj in your younger years and have since grown out of it , or may be an intj who has learned to be a bit more social . if you feel that way about entp then you probably arent one . i still wanna say enfp but i admit , i don't know too much about introverted intuition to rule out enfj . i agree with you that most ... wow , your results are funkay lol . well , i think you could turn out either way . i'd consider myself en * p but i can see you as either entp or enfp , but i still lean more heavily on enfp . i say do some ... i think the ne is as obvious as day , and i strongly suspect fi but try this jungian cognitive function quiz have you ever considered taking a cognitive functions quiz ? edit : the reason i'm asking is cause ne in general is big on seeing other possibilities and perspectives judging by what you wrote here , and in your original post , you seem to show fi preferences . people seem to think that enfps can't debate , or that they're not analytical or they can't hold their ... enfps have inferior si , which is the ' detail ' function . it happens lol . i'm an entp and i have inferior si too and i am capable of being pretty detail oriented . i also do that same thing you do , ...
