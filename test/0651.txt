' mountain lions ( aka cougars , pumas , catamounts , panthers , etc ) . they really are amazing animals . for example , pound for pound they are the strongest of all the big cats . this is because they can take ... i've done this to several people , but never in the context of any sort of romantic relationship . when i've abruptly stopped talking to someone online it's usually come down to one of two reasons : ... i've thought about this a little bit , and when someone is overly nice to me i often find that i doubt their sincerity . i become suspicious and wonder if they want something ( usually money ) . so ... yes , a smile or a quick comment to stall for time would be more polite . and snapping at people all the time usually has the effect of making them hate you . but if you get a little irritated every now ... we're not nice . in fact we're cannibals . i don't know why i thought of that . on another note entirely , top gear is perhaps the best show ever made . jeremy clarkson is funnier than all american ... eh , i wouldn't beat yourself up over that . it's natural to get irritated when we're interrupted . after all , if someone interrupts your train of thought and you snap at them you can always apologize ... yes , but if you way the same as a duck it means you float on water . if you float on water then you're a witch and must be thrown in the river . although i'm not sure what that will accomplish , seeing ... i startle incredibly easily , particularly when faced with sudden noises or movements . in fact my startle response is exaggerated enough that at one point my doctor had me see a neurologist and go ... unfortunately there will never be true world peace . cynical though it may sound , conflict is part of our human nature . there will always be those who dislike people who are different than them , there ... in all seriousness i don't think i've ever cried in public , at least not since i was like 6 . about once or twice a year i'll cry by myself because i let my own problems overwhelm me . but i'm more ... welcome to the forum ! oh i will so steamroll you ! actually no , i'm abnormally laid back for an enfp . besides , steamrollers are loud and smelly . if i was going to run you over with anything rest assured it'd be quiet and ... yea , i doubt all infps are easily offended . chances are it's just the ones i've been around . or like you said in your second response it could be that something about me activates their insecurities ... we seem to agree on lots of things , which is something i'm not used to ! i have mixed feeling about infps . i think female infps ( i don't know any male ones ) are quite possibly the cutest people on the planet . i also like the fact that they're not overly loud and it's easy ... well , i tend to wake up several times during the night since i'm not very good at sleeping . when i do wake up one of my most common thoughts is , where am i ? sometimes i even ask the question out ... you're welcome :) no , it was her dog so it's her responsibility to clean up after it . that's doubly true in this situation , because her dog pooed on your property ; people get sued for less than that in the u . s . if she ... this : i am so excite ! what is the airbourne velocity of an unladen swallow ? so you're saying you miss me ? aww , how sweet ! i didn't know you had feelings for me ! not a serious fight , no . rest assured that if ever i were to find myself in an unarmed combat scenario , i would undoubtedly win . i cheat ;) why , do i look like a fighter to you ? dude , i forgot i ever wrote that ! actually now that i'm reading it again , it feels like someone else wrote it . have i really changed that much in such a short time ? that happens all the time , bro . i love it when people constantly change topics ! it makes conversations so much more exciting ! staying on one topic for too long makes me bored . well , unless it's a really cool topic . welcome to the ... i hate it when that happens :d ry : you know how to explain that , right ? aliens ! dude , what's the big deal ? you're acting like i'm throwing a giant wooden rabbit at you or something ! aliens bro , it's always aliens . 34236 that's a cool movie , mostly because of yoda and lando . return of the jedi is my favorite though ! well pardon me if i got a little confused ! i'm sure you can understand : they're both mammals , about the same size , and their names look similar ! well , that's assuming chinchillas really are mammals ... okay fine , i'll make it bigger . but first i'm gonna go have a gasoline fight ! did you bathe her with water ? sweet ! i haven't watched the original trilogy in years ! how does one perform hug cpr ? to me it seems like it'd be very hard to hug someone and give them cpr at the same time . or does it ... next time you should come to cleveland . it's like cincinnati , but it sucks a lot more . even anthony bourdain couldn't find anything to do there . definitely worth visiting ! : laughing : like what ; helping kids who can't read good learn how to read good , and do other stuff good too ? i know , right ? all that niceness just isn't natural ; i bet she's planning something ! maybe she's trying to be nice to you so she can be your friend and stuff . how dastardly maniacal ! : laughing : what up bro ? just some advice , stay away from those scumbag enfps . they're even worse than horny robots , they're horny humans ! ha , i knew you were gonna say that ! it's cool though , i love to original star wars movies ! there's so much philosophical depth to them , and lightsabers are cool ! you mean i'm the only crazy person who isn't stalking you ? oh dear , you must have a very ' interesting ' life ! : laughing : haha okay , i'll try ! but if your skin was clear we'd be able to see right through it . that'd be nasty ! : crazy : i'm beginning to think your sn is a reference to your hair color . or can you genuinely turn your skin orange on certain days ? if so that would be excellent camouflage , if you were hiding in a pile of ... haha , you mean a super-slow-mo hug ? i'll see what i can do ! hopefully sillasy will hold still long enough , as it may take me a good 5 minutes to get my arms around her :D then you get a hug ... to be honest , part of me hopes i never become fully well-adjusted . i feel like i'd be sacrificing my individuality or something like that . of course well-adjusted was probably the wrong term to use ... every form of addiction is bad , no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol , morphine , or idealism . carl jung it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society . jiddu ... dude , catching butterflies is way too hard . instead , i'm going to dress up like a flower and wait for the butterflies to catch me ! ! then a hug you shall have :) well there goes that theory . then how she be so normal ? i know , she's an alien ! ! : crazy : honestly , you don't look awkward , vulnerable , or naive to me . at least not that much . you look friendly , a little shy , and very lovable . in case there are any annoying self-help book authors reading ... i'm glad you don't prefer partners who aren't flawed , otherwise you'd be a very lonely woman ! that would make me sad , because you're awesome . i was very surprised when i saw your pic , because for some reason i was convinced you were male . i think it's because whenever i read your name i think you're me . aw , you're so cute ! i'd hug ...
