' why . lol thank you yvy lol i find the biggest difference being that isfj's have this tone or aura of tradition / sentimentality around them . infjs can be a bit terse , momentary , point blank . well in a discussion on societal issues , i don't really get swayed by other's opinions as much as i get swayed by where they are coming from , emotionally * . it's one thing to be an intelligent free ... this is why my entp best friend and i often go are we even different types ? ? ! lol in some cases infj and entp seem very similar , but that's just the outside . i think it has to do with both being ... very true , same for me except i never took too long to burn a bridge . xd well if you're talking most people . but being able to see into another person's weaknesses and insecurities sometimes ... i'm a dick in situations where i'm really excited by a new connection or friend to the point i initiate conversations , ask for their number , and find myself getting home not wanting to talk to them ... interesting ... without many bumps or crazy spikes , or with bumps and crazy spikes they somehow juggle really well ? :p uffer : i picture two rather androgynous and whole beings when i think of this . i've been gone from the forums for too long and i am not asleep still lol this is bit random but it crossed my mind , wanted to see what others ' could cook up from it ... curious . what we know : say ... i'm pretty fixed on the idea of having a partner who is mentally , emotionally , physically , and spiritually compatible with me . if any of those are compromised i'd just not marry and fill my own cup ... need to learn to forgive myself for perceived wrongdoings towards other people ... sometimes i think i do a disservice or hurt / offend someone when maybe i didn't , but still it's like - wince - i cant ... i didn't see the word listed in the link ( or im blind lol ) but id probably say the most uncomfortable feeling for me , that i experience a lot , is foolish . i think it may be a setback , a double-edged ... i've never dated an isfp but ive known one or two . i'd say it's a very comfortable and sympathetic dynamic , but not really in the realm of partnership or longterm relating . like lavendersnow ... idk if i can relate to this experiment tbh ... probably because it doesn't feel organic . i think ... it'd be more efficient for you to decipher whether you prefer to use the ni se axis or the si ne one . they have distinct differences . if you are pretty well developed in si then you're ... dying asleep . lol or in my lover's arms . same difference . never clicked on a thread so fast lol it's true . sometimes i even confuse my own self . if i'm having a really good time 1:1 with someone , i start to think to myself wait ... do i like this person ... tbh my ti is a pinch higher than my fe , so i think often that's why i might type out as an intx . but this is due to my need to be fair , impartial / unbiased and freedom-giving . i can be pretty fixed ... it could be that you are still an intj but just strengthened your fi function . i'm like this only with strangers or those i want to make a good impression / establish and maintain a close bond with . lol in all other cases i think i am just calm ... or melancholy ... i don't really ... sounds istp from here . xlillithx tbh its half true that im comfortable with my fe being ambivalent . some of it is due to the fact i was overly codependent and a doormat in my younger years , i fe se looped a lot . now its ... it's not that you change personality type . it's just as you grow and progress , and discover new sides to yourself , you realize all the different ways your functions express themselves . you could have ... xlillithx i agree with all you said xd and same , my ti / fi is higher too or at least , my fe has become a lot more ambivalent in the past couple of years . i actually hold the same beliefs as you do . lol i actually don't think that going vegan or choosing to stop eating / doing anything is actually bringing you closer to understanding how the world is , or ... rome , italy has always felt like a part of me despite me never being there . like the person above me i think it's just having to do with my personality . on starseeds , i actually used to research ... feeling like i did something very wrong and out of bounds ... it's like a cold feeling of having done a disservice to someone i care so much for , when i was thinking it was the right thing to do , or ... 1 . visit south korea , japan and / or rome / italy . 2 . visit washington d . c . the pentagon and white house just seem like good places to go to and breathe in the essence of power . lol 3 . go to arizona or ... aww :) thats sweet . hm maybe someday soon youll experience something similar , with someone like her too haha hmm id say not . however my mom is the neat freak of the household . idk how many times i wash my hands a day or disinfect stuff all on her command ... lol but shes very much serious about order and ... ; ___ ; - squeezes - same . i do it too . xd idk if id go with the long hair thing as it doesnt sound very exclusive to the type imo ... , but definitely natural color makes sense for an infj . i have really long hair that i personally keep at ... just finished reading it . :) those two were definitely soulmates ( not tfs afterall haha ) .. i really liked the overall lessons they learned from each other ; - ; oooo ive never read this title . ;) i think ill start on it asap . :D since you brought it up earlier , would you say the characters in this manga are twin flames ? lool ... whoa what omg this is a brilliant thread . i shall return once i have a recent dream worthy of sharing :D - bounces away - it's one of my favorite rom-com movies too xd my favorite scene has to be the moment she tells him to write his name and number on a dollar bill , to which he said .. you are a strange ... and ... someone will probably bring up the term twin flames if you go saying that . :p whoops , guess its me . have you seen the movie serendipity my friend ? it features an infj female ( don't know for sure what the lucky guy is lol ) .. but i think you'll probably have to not look for your infj lady and simply ... reminds me of someone very special ... same xd im told im very direct and straight about how i feel whether its towards a situation or the people i am talking to . maybe one has given up hope , but if there is still a desire there then there is always a way for it to be received . :) this sounds like a question similar to nature or nurture ? lol ... i think it is both , or to simplify it , we play out and nurture what is naturally of our nature . we are born to be ready to take on ... noah : how ya hangin ' , harry ? old guy : well i keep trying to die but , they won't let me . noah : well you can't have everything . - the notebook xd lol well ... my isfj friend from canada sometimes messages me and she mentioned one time that she doesn't feel she should interrupt me when i am talking ? lol also ... - - - - super recent texting convo ... chocolat :) you know i fell into a really bad depression phase too . actually , it changed me forever and i think remnants of it are still lingering around to this day . thing is though , ive come to ... oh gee , thank you . xd faith in ? hm ... well i'd never say i have no faith in humanity , since that isn't how i process things or others decisions . however i wouldn't go on to say i have faith in humanity either , because i ... istj all the way . i don't see fe ti preference at all . : hampster : rainismycolour oh my do i have a crush on the rain too : hampster : sounds like a trick question for some reason . lol i'm sure i've met plenty of isfjs but i have only considered two to be good acquaintances of mine ... they both call me a friend , but idk im not ...
