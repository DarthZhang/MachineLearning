' the fact this is a thread makes me so happy ! anyway , i 100 % agree with ; chris , kem , amber , dom , sam and marcel ( really nice to see a mature estp here because it proves the stereotype wrong ) i am ... i believe she really does that out of the goodness of her heart , with no hidden agenda . vulnerable stefan needs hugs and affection , she's the first he sees when the safe door opens , and , for a ... according to how i define it , i can handle other's emotions x96 thatx 92s not the problem . imo , emotions or feelings don't have to make sense , according to an external logic : ... this is really ... and this is not a trait that changes throughout the story . then what examples can you give of it later on ? you have not given any example of neville working through things with fi other than ... fe / fi is not the primary interactive mechanism of mbti , they're more so the place between opinion and action , like a middle man , if that makes any sense . for example , the way that fi deals with ... ross - likely an isfj , i guess he could be an istj ( i've heard some good arguments for it ) but i think isfj is more likely either way si dom 100 % . joey - esfj , i know he gets typed as an esfp a lot ... i used to think n . was an isfj but when re-reading the books recently i re-typed a few characters and he happened to be one of them ( hagrid was another ) . anyway back to n . i wish i could see him as ... i honestly don't remember vincent well enough to weigh in on his type with total confidence , i remember thinking he was an enfp but could be wrong about that . but who i do remember really ... since from all you have said it seems tat your thinking preference is lower then fi vs . fe is good place to start because typing off profiles instead of cognative functions is harder and opens more ... just about that what each type as a hard time admitting to themselves thing it comes originally from thought catalogue and a lot of the people on there write about mbti based on sterotypes and ... first thing i would say when typing yourself is however ( sorry to say this ) , but avoid online tests ( and the 16personalities website all together ) . i have come out as every type under the sun on online ... i can help type you if you want :) my thoughts : harry potter - isfp ron weasley - esfp hermione granger - estj fred weasley - entp george weasley - entp ginny weasley - estp bill weasley - infp percy weasley - istj neville ... my thoughts : harry potter - isfp ron weasley - esfp hermione granger - estj fred weasley - entp george weasley - entp ginny weasley - estp bill weasley - infp percy weasley - istj neville ... i would agree that louis is an istj ( can we just appreciate how good he is with the details and bylaws ? ) , i just also think he is an ennegram 4 ( and not a healthy one ) which is why we see his fi quite ... haha , it's funny you say that , because as an xnfj i also feel like i wouldn't be able to do what he does ! it seems like he keeps track of so many things and his attention to detail and memory are ... but he set literally everything up , the curse , getting to stroybrook to get to his son and to do so he played such a long game it was all so clearly planned and done and involved so much forward ... elena and te . yep pretty much , although i think you could argue that we first saw her te with jeremy in the bathroom at school when she thought he was high . it was less intense than it is later on ... that's interesting because i've never seen him typed as an isfj before , where do you see si him ? i just think i struggle with it because the way that he always plays the long game and plans so far ... hey :) exactly ... i'm still wondering if elena wasn't actually supposed to be an isfj in the beginning , or maybe she was suppose to be a sweet depiction from memory of a very young estj ! ! ? ? ? i ... i never saw her struggle for survival as an abstract ... on the extroverted j function that accompanies the ni . with you , although at first glance katherine does look like an unhealthy entj , i agree ... again , very true , but when taking important action , one uses their best assets â€“ their dominant function . that is not a choice , it is a need . true , my point wasn't that decisions are made often ... all honesty , i am not 100 % sure if jess is an enfp or not , i had thought she was but ... either way , i feel like this post applies since jess is the stereotypical enfp's : ... i've been wondering about their enneagram types though : elena : 1 ? 6 ? 9 ? honestly she is really hard for me to work out . stefan : probably a 1 but i could also really see him as a type 9 damon : type 7 ... interesting idea , but i'm not really sure he can be . i mean for one , any type can be an artist the whole artist = infp thing is a bit of a stereotype really but looking at the case of klaus for him ... first of , ( just wanted to say without quoting all that was said on it ) i am in agreement with you about the estj profile in general and for most estj's i would agree with this , it is why we see so ... if it helps , what helped me with my enfp mother was i looked at what i was like when i wasn't around her , i mean my ne is still stronger but when i am not around the enfp's in my family my ne is ... yeah i agree i just can't work out if he is an intp or istp have you read this post ? it really highlights how much higher ne and lack of si makes an ne dom ... i'm with you on the fact that he is no way an esfp or enfp , i thought about isfp and infp but at this particular moment i lean towards intp ( or at least ti dom ) i'm just not sure how much fi i see in ... honestly i've got a bit of a head cold right now and my mind isn't 100 % so i hope that made sense . very possibly , if it helps , maybe consider the lower functions rather than the upper ones . i had the opposite problem i was getting to caught up in if i used ti or ne higher and due to circumstances ... maybe she is an entj , but something else that crossed my mind , her pregnancy was one mistake and i don't know about you guys but i don't act only using my cognitive functions and never do anything ... i'm with you on what he should of done , it seems unlikely that the information was out there but i would have a hard time believing that a high te user wouldn't make a list of the ones it could have ... so i was having a conversation with a friend of mine when we were trying to work out his type and something we touched upon made me think of chris . it was basically , situation vs . natural ... also , is her fi really that high ? i mean do we see her making the emotional decision often , or just a few times ? she doesn't take stefan with her , she doesn't immediately go and search for her ... if by social appropriation you mean fe's desire to manage everyone else's emotional well being and influence it in such way that it would insure group harmony as seen fit by the fe , then you are in ... well i have never been taught the enneagram by a professional or come across the triad theory in a book i've read so the best i can do is give you my personal experience and hope that helps . as ... is stefan ? he seems pretty ... well , rigid in his morality , and he self-denies a lot in order to control his evil ; seems like a 1 tendency ? [ / quote ] maybe , i hadn't actually thought about it before ... type 6 wing 5 : the defender x95problem solvers , good communicators , educators x95also attracted to professions such as medicine , law and engineering where they can master a system of knowledge ... i know it is on audible if you have that don richard and russ hudson riso but as for the wing i read the power of the enneagram for your wing type looking into the type if it is a core type and not as a wing is a lot better . :) but as for your question , my grandma is massively into the enneagram and she has a lot of book on it so i read them and worked out that i use more three than 6 , i am really not as fear based as a ... i'm a 136 , a 139 isn't a tritype because 1 and 9 are in the same triad : if it helps what made it really clear tome that i was a type one was looking at the types that one integrated and disintegrated to . aw thanks but there is really no need to thank me , i love typology and real people are always more fun than fictional characters to me buttt , back to the enneagram . now i will admit that i have ... unless you are really sure you are a down to earth person because then type 4 enfp seems highly unlikely well no problem and as for the enfp type 6 vs type 4 thing i will answer the question , i just want to make it quite detailed so i might be a few minutes :) you don't need to apologise for that mate xd it was just some advice you don't have to follow it if you don't want to .
