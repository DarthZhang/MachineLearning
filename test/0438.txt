' it happens to a lot of people . especially if this online quiz result says i'm an intp is their main reasoning for thinking they're an intp . they don't believe there's anything our minds that's outside of our conscious awareness ? i don't know how that could work because we use our primary instinct so much that we don't really need to think about it . that's why i can't stand 9s . sjs actually believe that shit . seems kind of like enneagram 1 crap too . they can't ? i hope you're joking . finally , a video that expresses how i feel about that show : what do you relate to in the type 5 descriptions ? yeah , me too . i definitely wouldn't want a pet that i need to thoroughly train , and which needs to be reminded which one of us is the boss or they'll decide to maim someone or something . and you ... same . feels good , man . ( though i basically just live with someone who has a cat . as much as i love the cat , if i lived on my own i wouldn't even have a pet ) nope . can't fucking stand it , actually . so instinct makes me bored just trying to think about it . and when i'm expected to be a good little so user ( ie . i accidentally wind up in a heavily so / sp ... things that women believe are universally true that's basically describing the difference between sx instinct and so instinct ( in the variant system of the enneagram ) . i'm sure sx is a lot more ... what about sp / sx ? thank you . i have no idea why people get the idea that sx = sex , relationships and love . this definition is really good : ... i wonder how integration / disintegration works with wings . does a wing also integrate and disintegrate to its corresponding types ? or is it only my main type that needs to reach healthy levels ? yeah , that's a pretty good point . i have a feeling there will never be an explanation of how exactly to do that , however . it's not necessarily that it's obnoxious ( as it would be in your example of instagram celebrities ) . i just find many so users disgustingly boring . they talk about shit that is so mundane , i can't ... wtb instinctual stacking / variants board cool template . are you going to eventually write in unique descriptions for each individual entry , or is this the final product ? might be true . i don't listen to enough popular music ( or watch enough popular tv series , etc . ) , but i know i see so / sp shit everywhere and i can't stand it . i find so instinct so insufferable . if i ... if you're not interested , then why would you want to know ? i've already wasted a decade of life , and no idea when it will end . same . :( it was defeated by liberalism / capitalism . all of those things suck , so i highly doubt it :P that sounds more like it . i think a lot of us are just interested in understanding typology , especially for those who have a 4 wing . exactly . i have no idea why people think that these forums should have the exact same distribution of personality types as the whole population . in what ways ? which parts are as much 6 as 5 , and ... who ? yes . so / sp instinct types ( and some sp / so ) . they are literally just a walking talk about things that are so boring , the human mind can't even conceive of them machine . people in their 20 ' s who are still children . i honestly don't even know how that happens . astrology isn't on the same level as typology . leave it in the garbage . how ? i don't see why not . it's ok , i was only kidding :P 2 things : intolerance of other people's cultures , and the dutch ignore all sensors . i can't imagine why they would 687138 no socialization instinct motherfuckers ( from enneagram instinct stacking : socionics - the16types.info - instinctual stackings ) feelers who believe they are le epic ti doms xd .
