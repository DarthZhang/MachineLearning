' i'm curious as to how many isfps relate to this . i've just recently identified in myself that i have a very slow temper . people with quick tempers get mad at things and then realize it wasn't ... what things can an isfp do to get more in touch with their ni ? what does it look like when they do ? the infj i know is very aggressive . he feels easily judged by the world and turns that back on those he anticipates conflict--which is nearly everyone . he has a hard time making friends because he ... thanks . i don't think you're sound harsh or any of that at all . he really is being crummy about this . i am actually fairly mad about it . i just also understand that most of the problem comes from his ... yeah . i just saw him last night at an event . he essentially said as little to me as possible . others said they got the same treatment . i think the most i can do is talk to one of his other friends ... he did take me aside a few weeks ago and talked to me about it ( though i think it has escalated a bit now ) . there may have been some newer insights since , but when i explained to him reasons why he ... yes . thank you . i figured it tended to be something along these lines . i feel horrible that he's taking it tough . i wish he could find away to see this whole thing in a way that doesn't leave him ... oh me too . i do understand that it might means the end of our friendship is coming . i just know he's getting hurt by this whole thing . i don't know how to make him see that he's doing it to himself ... i wouldn't talk to them to in order to have them relay my message as a so-and-so said ... i'm just fairly sure he won't listen to my point of view from me . i would just ask that they try to get ... he's kind of an atypical infj . you guys are described as mega-peaceful . he likes raging and shouting ( though normally it's not serious , just troll raging ) . i think it has to do with the environment ... that's pretty much it . more info on the whole situation : a huge thing is that he used to live in our dorm last year . now he doesn't . with his new dorm , he decided before going in that he would ... my infj friend has been really sensitive to feeling left out of ' the group ' the last couple of months . he's threatened to just stop being friends with us entirely because he feels like no one is ... getting different results on the test are more likely due to the conditions in which you took the test . i got five different results from the tests i took online when i started simply because i ... they're both equally horrible . on economic policy , right . with most social issues , left . politics suck . how does one cheer up a heartbroken istp ? he says normally he just process these things logically and can get over them . however , this one is taking a toll . it probably just needs time--since it's ... he doesn't make it clear that he's just stressed vs . legitimately doesn't like someone anymore . i've seen him stop talking to people that he no longer wants to be friends with . it's very similar to ... he's most definitely and estp . very much so an e . considered him being an i for a moment once , and it was so very , very wrong . he just acts weird sometimes . i suppose that would ... is there anything i can do to help him get out of it ? will he even listen to me ? i don't want to bring it up and then have it come off as accusatory . i just want him to realize that he hurts people ... i have an estp friend . he's a great guy . i love to be around him . there's just one tiny problem ... i've noticed that he has the tendency to just shut down almost everything around him when under ... the op isn't using the words liberal / conservative in a political context though . it's about our interpretation of scriptures . i know an enfp girl dating and isfp guy , and from what i can tell the girl is the clingy one . why not just joy then ? joy is a wonderful name for a girl . for a boy , i might go with peter . christian . i was raised christian , quit for a while , and found my way back because it was where i always belonged . i respect other people for their beliefs though and don't try to shove mine on ... i'm scared of setting expectations . my feelings change easily . i'll like a guy one day and stop liking him the next . i'm scared to initiate anything because i'm afraid he'll see it as me leading him ... when i'm angry i cry . i hate people seeing me cry , so i go get angry in a room by myself until i cool down and blow off some steam . then , if the problem is still an issue , i'll try to talk to the ... before going to college i dyed my hair teal . one of my closest friends today was an enfp who sat down next to me at lunch , and said you have green hair , and i think that's something i would do if i ... firedell ahhh ... i know . awkward silences are the worst . i feel like i know what i'm talking about when it's filling the void of an awkward silence , but i just need ... something--anything--there , ... apparently i have a habit of talking a lot--but only with people i'm really comfortable with . it's a simple equation , the more i'm comfortable with you , the more i'll talk around you . so we just ... lilies ah , then i guess my understanding of ni if wrong . i had a feeling if one of my understanding of functions was wrong it would be that one . thanks for the correction . that makes a lot ... well being an isfp or an infp , you're looking for which one you're auxiliary with . you could also try to see if you relate to tertiary functions at all ? an isfp uses se and ni and an infp ne uses ... hmmm ... maybe examples would help ? i was talking to a friend about mbti once , and i pegged her as an exfp . i tried explaining s and n to see where she fit in . i even tried to explain se and ne , ... main difference between se and ne is that se deals more with concrete information and ne concerns itself with abstract . an se is aware of their environment and takes in information through their ... pretty much any by regina spektor .  i don't think we actually are working towards anything in particular . we just like to enjoy the present . kind of the point of an se , if you ask me . : kitteh : i would say that isfps makes ... from my point of view , the inferior function is often the one that we lack . in my life , te has been the weakest aspect myself . i'm not organized or disciplined . when i'm forced to accept decisions ... what firedell said . understanding the functions help a lot . i found that i don't even have to mention the test to some people to find their type . if i know them well enough and observe properly , i ... back home , i'm friends with a esfp . at school , it's an enfj , estp , entj , and estj who i'd consider my best friends . beyond them , i know and intp , isfp , enfp , infj , istp and esfj . it's weird ... i'm actually interested in hearing this too . but not fi , and she makes to many subjective decisions based on feeling . i support dany as an fe-user . i see infj in her . and then she stills names one of her dragons after him . the way she reasons it though is not the mark of an fi . i relate to her in every way , other than the fact that she's logical . especially once i picked up the books and started reading . i'll be ... my responses to on arya : and on tyrion : i agree with renly . viserys just shout immature j to me , but i'm not determined on that . for catelyn , i think she seems to use in a fe-dom , ... impulsiveness is in the se side of her . i relate to that . there are parts of her narrative where she is very rational though . she keeps quiet around the other night's watch because she logically ... i don't see fi in arya . not at all . she makes too many objective decisions and her pov chapters don't sound like the workings of an fi child . she's also not and esfp because she doesn't behave like ... my new favorite tv show is game of thrones , and i'm currently working my way through the books . i thought it would be fun to do some typing here . starks ned : istj catelyn : xsfj . i lean towards ... yeah . it could be age . or it could be the isfp se-aux function creeping in on us . we do like living in the present . ;) i was going to go into nursing before it dawned on me that i have a true hatred for science . i switched to a double major in studio arts and psychology . i've always been fascinated by ... i want to say yes . i want to ... however , i would have to disagree . for me , thinking about the long-term scares me . i want the meaningful relationship--i really do--but thinking of life with some ... i think she's a ti user , not fi . she makes too many logical decisions when under emotional stress and her pov chapters in the book depict her as fairly objective in her decision making . i do think ... 1 . do you have a tendency to be conscientious around other people ( trying not to be rude ; not to hurt them etc . ) and to what extent ?
