' kill : perez hilton ( because he's a fucking parasite on society ) save : jfk ( because he may have never allowed vietnam to happen ) thanks for sharing . i am hesitant to see a headshrinker . i used to have a lot of anger issues and sought help through a psychologist ( x2 ) . the first one was a brit that kept asking me how i felt ... if you don't mind , what type of doctor did you see ? i have a lot of the same struggles and with work , a wife , 3 kids ( and all of their activities ) , 2 dogs ... i often feel like i'm on a ... i'm pretty much in the same boat , except i married the right woman : cool : ( 18 years and counting ) . life is what you put into it ... if your sitting around waiting for someone to make it better , you ... the only one i know is just evil . she is a gossip hound that not only collects and spreads rumors , but also enjoys outting people in public with a smile . i am very careful in dealing with her , ... agreed . but trying telling that to the people of mexico . poor bastards . i only know of one for sure ( all of us here at work were tested at the same time ) and i can't stand her . she uses her powers for evil . this is very well said ( and accurate ) . i just got a new boss and he has been interviewing people around the office to get a feel for who they are and what they represent . about an hour into our ... i work with one and she is a fucking bitch that uses her powers for evil . couldn't get past the first paragraph ... so why is he leaving ? un-cool ! it's stunts like this that make people numb to legitimate pleas for help . wait until you begin the job interviewing process ! it's like a stupid question nightmare , where they pummel you with scripted questions designed to educate them as to what kind of employee you may ... arrogant douchebag , cold-hearted bastard , mad-at-the-world , smartass ... etc . most people just can't handle the truth . perhaps i could be more sensitive in my delivery , but then people would just ... hell yeah ... especially if humor is involved . as for our capacity for evil ... i think we are more than capable of some pretty dark shit , but are kept in check by the things we value ... when it comes to friends and family , there's always at least a shred of truth to what they say , simply because they know you better than most people ... which is why it tends to sting a lot more than ... slipnot indulges my dark , angry side . doesn't this fit all entps ? ... that is so fucking dark ! i love it . perhaps , but without a plan this revolution is doomed . they're pissed off about corporate greed ... me too ! now what ? even the liberal media will abandon these potato heads if they don't establish ... i agree . and before souljorn comes a callin ' , i don't watch foxnews . my opinion is based on protestor interviews i have read on msnbc.com and seen on cnn . sure it's the liberal media , but since i ... i'd like to be able to travel back in time to test the accuracy of things like the bible , jfk's assassination , obama's birth ... etc . option # 1 : go back to school , get a degree in journalism . as an entp , you should be able to do this standing on your head . then , using your degree , get a job in corporate communications . next to ... personally , if i were this bully and you presented me with the facts about my behavior in a kind , but firm way ... i would give your words some consideration and probably change my attitude . then ... that depends ... would it bother you if this person tells you to go fuck yourself ? so what you are saying is that you are a deviant and it feels good ? me too ! welcome to the party . you are full of shit ! think of it this way ... at work , i try to hit home runs everyday . sometimes i only hit singles and doubles ... sometimes i hit foul balls or strike out ... but every once in a ... very well said and accurate ! i was in a fucking nasty mood yesterday when someone here at work pissed me off . it didn't pass until i woke up this morning . i think these moods are even nastier ... i love it when my kids try to tell me some shit like this ... it's like they are daring me to fuck with them . spoken like a true entp , however most 8 - year-olds don't have the capacity to simply suck it up and ' handle it ' . all he needs to know is that the medicine is for his own good and not because he is ... i like the dickhead label better than hipster . i am right there with you . i too have concerns about long-term effects and also the current social stigma he may face personally and from his peers . however , our doctor has said that most kids ... i was the same way with our 7 - year-old ( who is now 9 ) . the thing is though that it is next to impossible to re-focus them at this age . you are not there to give him the tlc ( or tough love ) that he ... that's not paranoia ... he is always watching . dad : istj or pathetic fucking asshole , that is dead to me ... take your pick . mom : infp younger brother : estp i am 40 + . my wife and i have been married for 17 years and the best advice i can give you is to be very specific and to the point when communicating with him . tell him exactly what you expect ... i agree with mb's high sex drive theory . i think sexual addiction is a bullshit excuse for someone that gets caught cheating and just doesn't have the guts to admit that they got caught .  ... 17 years and counting . marriage is only for those that are capable of commitment and willing to do whatever it takes to make things work . if you can't ( or won't ) do this ... if your thirst is ... adolph hitler , napoleon bonaparte , julius caesar and darth vader ( to name a few ) were all entjs ... i highly doubt that any of them were some entp's bitch . you are right . it was my lame attempt at humor . have you ever tried cock blocking your clearly more attractive friend ? wait until he goes to the bathroom and say , yeah ... joe sure is a great friend ... especially since he finished that ... exactly ! joke'm if they can't take a fuck . i come here when i am bored ... haha . at work , i make a list of things i want to accomplish during the week on monday morning . this list is comprised of items that are in addition to my normal ... he represents the district i live in , but to tell you the truth i have no idea who he is or what he represents other than what i have read on wikipedia . his son , rand , is an interesting character ... this kind of storytelling strength is especially helpful in raising children . you can use it to teach lessons , create a tighter bond and have fun ... my young daughter noticed that people often leave ... this really resonates with me ... especially the patterns ( you see them too ? ) ... haha . however , sometimes i think it's important to drink this koolaid in small sips . the last time i was on this board ... no shit . either explain it or shut the fuck up ! i smoked weed everyday in high school . i did everything stoned : school , dinner with mom , traffic court ... etc . then i went into the marines , in which i only got high once ( during the gulf war ) . ... the only problem that i can see with getting a journalism degree is that at some point you will be writing for an editor and this sorry excuse for a human is going to piss all over your work of art ... puff , puff , pass ... bogart ! really ? you failed to establish the joke . wtf ? please explain .
