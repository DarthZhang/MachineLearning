' oh . i understand your viewpoint . yeah , this generation is in a weird position when it comes to technology . we seem to have a love / hate relationship with it that other generations don't understand . ... that is crazy though ! i would have never thought a main help desk person would not know how to set-up a computer . i have a possible feeling that the folks in your workplace were not exposed to ... wait really ? so you're saying you might have started pokemon go trend ? : laughing :: laughing : yeah , that's why i asked if it could be a trick up in their sleeves to say that while secretly bashing ... actually , that would depend on how one divides the decade . not everyone uses the early / mid / late designations . there are folks out there who use the halves formula and others who use the quarters ' ... now that it has been a few years since this topic was created , i'm going with 2016 . for those who said 2013 and ' 14 are the definitive years of this decade are honestly wrong . those two years were ... i really hope there's a change coming very soon ! i'm honestly tired of the mid - 10s for the simple fact it has been horrendous . hopefully , the late 10s turns to be much better and give this decade a ... i thought 90s nostalgia has been huge for some time . with all the revivals of tv shows , fads , fashion and more , i thought that was enough to indicate that 90s was in and 80s was out . however , i ... i'm honestly going to put this out there , and say that most people are practically hybrids even if their childhood leans in one era or another . i don't see anything wrong with folks in the 90s / 00s ... whoa ! : shocked : everyone should at least know how to use a pc if they have an it job . it's not that difficult . that makes me wonder how they got hired if they don't know to use one . : confused : i ... that's what i wanna know . just a month ago , there were articles stating that millennials were killing everything , eating avocado toast and all the other bs . : laughing : now , it all changes a week ago ... i agree with your entire post . 20-30 years in front of a computer is a lot more time to know how to code , program things and more . the older folks in your workplace were not only lazy , but they're ... good news people ! after all the bs that millennials have received over the years , they are finally being seen in a positive light . i came two articles today stating that millennials are doing much ... i totally agree ! yeah , it does sound like some folks forget that technology is a gradual process , not an instant one . in fact , despite that the iphone was released in 2007 , most people didn't have it ... that's very true . it seems that lots of people forget that millennials are known for more than just tech such as optimism , idealism , adventurous etc . no . the first full year of gen z is 1995 which is the hs class of 2013 . 1993 and ' 94 are generally considered to be millennials . too bad you weren't here a few years ago . there were many people of ... i didn't need to because i have seen that link a thousand times . yeah , it says the typical start is the mid - 90s , but that does not that mean it's 1993 or ' 94 . again , either no source or very few have ... no 1995 is the beginning . gen z starts with the hs class of 2013 . sources even state that . hold up ! ppg wasn't popular anymore in 2004 and ' 05 . oh , and i take back when i said that show ended in ... well , that is because you're not reading enough sources . most references have 1994/95 as the end , not much earlier than you believe . oh yes , they were . 1991 folks were children when ppg premiered , ... no . what those comments are showing is that the xennials are pretty much the older millennials , and are trying way too hard to fit with gen x even if they wanted their own mini-generation . besides , ... this is an excellent rundown on each generation and its descriptions , and i like the chart . the only issue i have with it is the designations . i truly think it each cohort should have two groups of ... this is an interesting perspective . i appreciate that you pointed those things out . i agree with what you said with on the last few points except for privacy . about the consequences of words , that ... nope , not at all . i do have male cousins though , and we all witnessed power rangers and pokemon . oh , and btw both fads were for guys and girls . what made you imply that power rangers and pokemon were ... i don't agree with that classification at all . all generations should be two groups . the whole early / core / late designations are frustrating and have made endless destructive debates in the past . ... so , she would have been in the minority then . the article stated that first-time moms were around 25/26 . it would have been rare for people in her age range to have children during that time . again , ... i never said she was . all i said was that she is gen x since it seems like she's in her early 40s . you said your mom is about 20 years older than you , and you're a 1993 person . that means she was ... so for the last few days , i have been looking at comments regarding the xennials ( or the oregon trail generation ) , and i have to honestly that they are pretty much older millennials whether they ... do you even know what early 21st century means ? it's not just 2000/01- 09 . if your mom is about 20 older than you then she's not a millennial . she would be gen x . again , yes some xers had kids in ... i think you really really misunderstood about what i said . i was talking about non-traditional college students . you can be one at any age . what is a ... i think you missed the point in my link . i said that about 20 states had a cutoff later than september 1st and there were some back then that had a december-january cutoff . so california , hawaii , ... i said it seems you don't remember when the internet was a luxury meaning that one was able to afford it before it was standard . not even ! ... true on that . facebook was definitely much more popular and had already taken over myspace by then , but i was just telling jaderose that just because it declined in 2008 doesn't mean it was dead . it seems that you have no clue what luxury means . i'm saying it was a novelty before it became common to have the internet as it reached 50 % in 2001 . that depends on the state . there are many ... yeah , you said that many times already , and i asked do you remember the internet when it was a luxury , not before it was common . you got the two confused . once again , myspace was popular between ... i didn't say they were not going to remember all of them . i said they were not going or recall some of them . oh , and it's ok if you don't remember columbine . not all younger millennials recall that ... no , i'm not . i already told you i have friends and even family with that range . once again , they're not going to generally remember all of those events due to their age when they all occurred . ... i think that would have still been rare though . i actually thought that those folks generally had xers as parents , but i found out a while ago that was not true . i have friends and i know people who ... i haven't said that 1977 was the cutoff for gen x . the generations forum already does that . oh , and no , the 1982-2000 span has only been referenced from one source which was strauss-howe . most so far ... how was it stereotypical ? yeah , you are . just admit already . all the descriptions i have read don't agree with what you said . the most known cutoff for gen z is 1995 , not much earlier than ... when it comes to the hybrid childhoods i say that the 2001-04 people are all both even if they all lean one way or the other . they all would discuss the late 00s and early 10s just as much equally ... i was just saying you're a conservative black person . you said it yourself sometime ago . i know . i was just saying that most were in school when that event happened . i'm starting to think that ... yeah , but it depends on what the discussion is about . 2010 2011 2013 2012 2017 2016 2015 2014 yeah , that's true that every generation has had criticism . i'm not going to deny that ; however , the thing is it's going too far with the whole killing this killing that and some other bs . that's ... yeah , they mean the same generation . it's just that some people don't seem to know what a millennial is . aside from sources using the 1982-2000 span , is there a reason why you think it should be that way ? it's because 2000 doesn't seem to be common as much as it used to , and a little more than half of ... you must have misread the link . it says signs stating how one is gen z and not a millennial . it never said that the folks are automatically z . oh , and i don't know why you keep using the 1982-2000 ... i just read this yesterday , and i agree with the signs stating how one is gen z and not a millennial . what do you all think ?
