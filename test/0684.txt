' yeah . usually i think of it as pretty close between infj and infp . mushr 00m , why are you surprised to see infp so high on the list ? although i guess infps aren't quite romanticized in the sense the ... i've gotta say , while i definitely saw pe-dom and i understand your confusion of se vs . ne , i definitely didn't see you as an fi-dom . i think you are quite extroverted . i just think people have a ... 1 . i am easily overwhelmed by strong sensory input . - yes . it's definitely overwhelming . it makes me feel blind - i can't tell what to focus on . i can't take everything in all at once . 2 . i seem ... yeah , i mean , i figured it out too . i just realized the drop box won't show up on my computer somehow . i can only guess it's because i can't interact with the document like non-chromebook users can ? ... oh , it doesn't show up on my computer . i have a chromebook . perhaps that's why . nipnip , call me technologically challenged , but i've no idea what you meant by drop down menu . actually , i'm just entirely unfamiliar with excel . however , i thought there was potential behind your ... shekinah , you might consider filling out a questionnaire . :) i skimmed some of your previous posts , but since you're so new here it's hard to say . i can say i don't think you're a fe / ti user . and i ... atheistgod , intelligence and what subjects you are good at doesn't really say much about your personality type . how could it ? intelligence is your ability to acquire and apply new knowledge and ... yes . but that is a good distinction . i think it is possible to be child-like and not childish . i think it's funny how people can see the childlike part and then assume the world i see is one of ... so , aside from all the relationship threads ... because for whatever reason , the enfp forum is flooded with those , i wanted to try and bring up a new topic for a bit . there's a side to the enfp ... hmm ... i don't know if i put on a performance . i do like to tell stories , though . when i do , it feels like sculpting . i'm trying to get the other person to feel what i felt . to have the same sense i ... so ... this isn't exactly a business idea . i have two big dreams right now . they're really the same thing , just expressed in different ways . the first is to wander across the country with my ... haha . it's all good . and i prefer to be direct . well , mainly i was curious why you say an esfj will only pretend to listen to your theories . what is it essentially about esfjs and enfps that ... what is your basis for saying all of these things ? all the esfjs i know have their own ideas and feelings just like every human does . they may be simply looking at a different piece of reality than ... type compatibility is a myth , remember . :) what's important is communication and willingness to work past differences . two of my absolute best friends are esfjs . i love them fiercely . they are both ... i am so sorry , friend . this is something i see all around me so much . it's strange ... brokenness and beauty - it's funny how you can find both of those things in one place , in one person . i'm ... haha . i definitely can overthink things . i'm either wondering or trying to feel out something's meaning or both . and people would definitely say i'm not very realistic . and hey , when i was younger , ... this is only going to be a partial reason . but one thing i noticed is that at least the infp and infj forums ... there's a lot of literature out there on those two types . people have this idea in ... so , we have cmbc , the intp who is in a relationship with the enfp . well , i incidentally am in a relationship with an intp . actually , we've known each other for our whole lives . we're best friends and ... let's see . enfp stereotypes . there are so many . in fact , i don't know if the perc community truly has grasped the enfp type . just some random stereotypes i've noticed : 1 ) enfps are super ... doktorin zylinder , you bring a perspective that is entirely different to my own . actually , most people here are . i do not hate people . i love people . i pay attention to how people think . the human ... riley is ... so not a ne-dom . i don't see that at all . i guess people are seeing how imaginative she was , but really . she was imaginative - but her imagination was very constrained to the world of her ... well , i see . thinking in general is repressed in enfps . i would imagine it would come out quite low . but also , if we're going by the mbti model , enfps use te , not ti . ( and even that is problematic . ) ... , i'm curious why you want to know ? also , isn't this a better thread for the enfp forum ? :) random side note : for the record , i absolutely suck at those sorts of tests . and i never took ... i do this , definitely . i feel like it would make more sense for this to be a fe thing . however , most fe-doms i know aren't looking for reactions . it's more like maintaining something . i feel ... thinking about what you said , angelcat . it's funny coming from the opposite point of view . because i'm the reverse . i'm ne > si . and fi / te . i forget so easily . ( and can fall into repeating the same ... cool test . i'm biologically female and also identify as being such . i got 45.833 / 100 masculine 85/100 feminine 68.33 / 100 androgynous sheesh . that makes me feel more girly than i think i ... let's see . usually when i write , i write my musings about things . my wonderings . my thoughts . it's very reflective . i'll have an interaction with someone , and it reminds me of a whole idea . suddenly ... charlie.elliot , * high fives * i got 15 too . and yes . so-called psychopaths generally have very high empathy . what they lack is sympathy . just because you know what someone is feeling does not mean ... , good question . love it . you see , there are many extroverts who would type themselves as introverts . some of this is to do with the varying definitions of what introversion and ... okay . take an enfp and an esfj . i'm an enfp no matter how you look at it - through dichotomies , functions , what have you . my friend who is now my roommate is an esfj - through dichotomies , functions , ... okay . so . yes . actually , thank you for posting this . i did indeed score enfp on tests ( and i do consistently - either that or i get the occasional infp ) . the thing is , i've validated enfp as my type ... joy is so fe that it's pretty crazy . :) think of rapunzel from tangled and how similar the two are in the way they think . i think joy is very much a solid esfj . joy doesn't care about possibilities ... riley ? enfp ? i agree she uses ne / si . but she prefers si over ne . and there is definitely no fi . everything in her imagination , everything in her mind ... they had nothing to do with perceiving ... ha . what made the huge difference for me was sequential . i scored pitifully low pretty much on cs and as . for cs i scored 4 ( essentially just 1 . stunnedfox , i want to know why i had to multiply ... first off , welcome to perc . ^ ^ it's a crazy place to navigate sometimes . but it's fun . all right , you've had lots of ideas thrown at you . tests aren't necessarily accurate . you know that ... sweettsubaki , i think that piglet is actually a good example of inferior ne . certainly not ne-dom . :) thousands upon thousands of negative possibilities ? oh yeah . inferior ne all the way . let's see . istjs . i've gotten along well with istjs in my life . my dad is an istj ( yes , really , not in the stereotypical sense ) . and we connect on some very interesting levels . with our ne and ... i'm afraid i simply don't agree with your typing of him still . nor do i agree with the reasons behind why you typed him as intp . i'm thinking about ti as jung defined it . you say he's an ... haha . darwin is a textbook te-dom . jung actually used him as an example for te . i think another good example of dominant te is dawkins . it appeals to standards ... it's objective , looks for evidence ... the thing is ... false love is pretty much the same thing as hate . and is there even such thing as honest hate ? i do not think there is . even if you say there is , hate is hate , honest or no ... hmm ... there are many . first off , i think that what many people think of as infp may actually be more typical of isfjs . i've addressed the misconceptions about enfp i don't like multiple ... hmm ... i don't think it's the social harmony thing . it's just the ideas around it and the feeling about it that i like . on top of just that , i'm a musician myself . i simply love music . i get lost in ... i like the idea behind this discussion . :) well ... i don't think you'll find extroverts more likely to love the upbeat social-gathering-y music . i don't think that's where you'll find a ... angelcat , i don't know if new cinderella was already discussed at length . but she confuses me . there was many a ne-trope . seeing things not as they are but as they could be . ... well . can't get ... it's hard to type studio ghibli characters . they're very well fleshed out . very complex . either that , or sometimes miyazaki's characters represent an idea . it's rather hard to type an idea . ... a coworker of mine who knew little of the theory more than just what the letters represented typed me as an intj . this amused me . i love getting people to guess my type face-to-face . see , many think ... tridentus , i can relate to that on a rather frightening level . i keep everyone an arm's length away . i'm really good at making people feel like i'm close to them , somehow . and they may come to ... and thus , we have introversion ! well , i don't know , really . but somehow that sounded like an introverted thing to say . almost like bringing your thoughts and how you experience things into ... so , i've grown up watching studio ghibli movies . i also watched the disney princess movies and stuff , but studio ghibli was more influential to me during my childhood . the characters are all so ...
