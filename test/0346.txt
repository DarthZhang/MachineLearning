' actually , if old testament god were to be tested as something , it would make more sense to be estj if you go by the functions . first off , morality is not an f thing . i classify as an infj , but i ... didn't really know how to phrase that title so sorry if there's any confusion . i'm trying to find out what exxx mbti type is the most introverted type and so on and so forth . not too sure on how to ... just as i can't speak for all infjs , i don't expect all of you to speak for all isfps . but i'm curious to know what truly is in your mysterious minds . perhaps there'll be similarities in your ... ikr , i'm surprised no one else mentioned that . i'm still in school and i can say that in the past and even now , if i'm not really close with anyone , it's extremely difficult for you to get close to ... i think this sums up everyone's opinion of us : wow , after looking at these answers , i'm not too sure if i'm an infj . maybe i'm just an intj that actually likes people more than myself . either that or the majority of you are just moody with fi ... not sure if i'm slightly unstable or if this is an ni thing but : love can be calculated as a strong and balanced amount of trust and joy . a liking for someone is more of just a serenity and acceptance . but to be in love . that's more of an ecstasy and admiration ... for some reason , i get the feeling that you took that a bit too much to heart . being an ni dom user , i can agree with a lot that the op mentioned . although , i also agree that we can be pragmatic and ... well , generally when i'm in hermit mode , it's because i simply don't want to be around others . maybe it's best to just give him that extra space . obviously , in that time you give him space you ... envy is the idea of something being superior to oneself . i always associated that more with fi / te considering their strong probability of superiority-inferiority complex . xstjs at least have si to ... wouldn't we be , you know ... kinda useless ? or would it be the opposite ? maybe we'd either be the pillars to hold the world together . or maybe just depressed because of a lack for ambition . i mean ... bah . i ask myself these questions all the time . we're not pretending to be whom we're not though . we're just really complex and flexible of the brain's cognitive functions . because of this , we're ... daughter eckis aww , it appears that i was a bit counterproductive . my apologies for making the wrong judgments , but at least you found your type . i hope it was as fun for you as it was for me :p roud : how about we just ask the op then . what do you think you identify as ? daughter i heard a lot of things regarding anxiety with fps especially social anxiety with ixfps . not too sure what it is really ... a sense of humor and hope for humanity ... no but seriously , it kind of just sophisticated itself more than went away lol . actually , just about everything i ever did has been through that kind ... diagnosed with general anxiety fi ( stereotype ) around my family , i act very aloof and anything that comes out of my mouth is a barely heard sound of a grunt to show i heard them or sarcasm . fi ... i don't know ... it didn't sound like fe to me either . but it was most certainly an ixfx . then again , you're another isfj so i'll assume that you know better than i do . if you see a lot of yourself in ... ins are chameleon types meaning that sometimes they act as their opposites to socialize . then you mentioned a lot of si notes but not too many fe . intp's tertiary trait is si and entp's tertiary is ... you're right , this definitely sounds ixtj . but it seems like he did a lot of things . intjs don't do stuff lol . they prefer to just think . intjs also dislike history a lot . mainly because our si ... wtf ? these are the only questions and answers that i understand lol . based on these you're definitely an infp though . i'm not sure how you got those cognitive functions with these answers . although ... so we both know that you're for sure an introvert . but here's the problem . you're not a judger based off of these answers . judging doesn't always mean organized . i'm fairly unorganized and i'm infj ... yeah w . w . was intj . perfectionistic , antisocial , always had that angry look on his face like he hated the world . if he had fe then he'd be a little more nice towards his friends and family . but ... interesting ... hmm . well they say that infjs are the most uncommon so that's possible . i think in terms of reading a person it's i because they're reserved , n because they're generally pretty quirky ... hmm , well while it's hard to find penguins in a jungle , they can be easily found in the southern hemisphere . the fact that you tread in the areas that general infps do mean that you'll find it easier ... i've noticed that pattern too . what i do is barter beforehand asking them if i do something for them can they help me with something else . if i'm in a good mood , then i'll do something for them just ... yeah i'm gonna go with isfp . the isfps i know are all into the simple things in life and can't really see the world for what it is . they're focused on their own values and things they love that they ... no no no . this is definitely inxj guys , you're right . but look , he's only in care for people relating to his own values . that's fi . so he's probably just an intj using fi . personally , as an infj , i'm ... so ? who cares if they judge you ? you are who you are and you shouldn't care what people say about you . you know what's true and what's not about yourself , not them . if you do care then you're ... that sounds like a waste of a wish lol . i think i like the mystery and being able to figure it out for myself . besides i think i'm starting to be able to do it alone anyway . very interesting idea ... wow this is really good lol . except i'm not too sure about isfjs and hate crimes ... they seem pretty calm like they won't do much of anything . maybe i'm wrong ? and why are infps in religious crimes ? ... not sure if i'm the only one who does this , but as a chameleon , my false estp persona grabs the attention of a lot of people that i don't really like too much . naturally , though i don't like them , i ... hmm not too sure . under influence of drugs you can look all kind of ways . usually inxjs are the least expressive though ... check this out ... i've seen infps more depressed than angry . i think you've caught on to this pattern as well . usually they let some small things go and the big things keep them down . especially when their values are ... that's either your memory playing tricks on you , your imagination , or both . infjs have quite a strong imagination so i assume that's what it is . i haven't experienced anything like that but i have ... i didn't read all of it but i do have a judgement . infp and infj is a terrible match . if i were you , i wouldn't trust either one of them and they shouldn't trust you either . you need to be with ... njs predict and plan the scenario then act accordingly to however the situation responds . nps improvise with a super quick brain process going off tangents until they get the right information . sjs ... infjs are sensitive , quiet , nerdy , useless , impractical , perfectionistic freaks who hate themselves so much that they act their opposite just to fit in even though they say they shouldn't because ... 213650 you aren't alone but you isolate yourself . sometimes you need to share your fe to others , that's why it's extroverted . share some of your writings to people you see interested . become ... albus dumbledore gandalf and faramir from lord of the rings obi-wan kenobi , qui-gon jinn , luke skywalker and yoda ( no wonder star wars was so popular ;) ) aslan from narnia the oracle from the ... well i'm 17 and i am , and from what i can remember have always been , like this . what i do is when at home or by myself or just in any environment where i'm not communicating with others in general , i ... because he's an entj . weren't you listening ? lol but seriously , to the op : yeah that's one of the most common traits of an entj so don't worry bout it . wanna get in depth about it with your own ... nj types are usually the most qualified for leadership positions . np is super independent and / or is too lazy to follow or lead . sp are also independent , but sometimes they like being in a team . sj ... omg i know an esfp type 3 loll . he's really cool to be around and everyone loves him except tjs ( i swear to god only tjs this is not an exaggeration xd ) . he's extremely ambitious and can be one track ... i always assumed that it would be better going with your opposite , but staying in the same world ( intuition vs sensing ) . it has to do with the functions ... idk how much you know about them but ... the left looks istj and the right looks intj lol . ( see the death stare ? ) both lack the smiling ability and have deadly , silent eyes . but the intj's is a little more indifferent , yet penetrating . all of us have aspergers lmao . just like how a lot of exxps ( especially estp ) have adhd . it's not a disease imo , it's a personality syndrome , but not disorder . but anyways , that seems like a really ... i'm best friends with two entjs and an enfj and the only one that knows the real me is the enfj lol . when i'm around entjs i'm extremely entp because i'm kind of like a weirder version of estp ( no ... wow that's sooo true lol especially the phrases in bold . maybe we're just the type of balance ... i always thought of infj as the buddhist monk type of mbti and they always strive for balance . this ...
