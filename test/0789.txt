( why ? ) i sometimes envy esfjs . like ... seriously . their social skills are thru the roof . but i would not switch , though . i'm just fine as a witty and crazy entp , even if i'm awkward as hell . yeah , another vote for xsfp . i have to be honest here . i totally hate sjws . they ruin everything , support restrictions to free speech , are totally ignorant themselves , claim others are nazis and refuse to listen them only ... enfp pure dope . for compability , i vote for 4w5 . 4w3 and especially 1w2 or 6s in general don't sound that good . though my insight on the subject is not too extensive . but i am still taking sides here . to add : i'm ... i think i'm just having a period of social anxiety or something ... this issue just suddenly popped up . been too tired or something constantly and it's draining my social skills and getting me ... damn , i just posted a thread about basically the same thing ... yeah , i think some of us get caught up and get awkward in some situations . i think i'm awkward at times . like , when people ask me how am i doing or what i have been doing i just don't know really what to say and get kinda locked up . then i either start stuttering awkwardly ... esxps . the unhealthy ones . i'm more intelligent than 99 % of people i'm super hot i know my sh * t i'm a total badass and i have a huge d * ck . do i have to say more ? : cool : you want it rough ? huh ? let's play it rough ... istp . i really see no way around that . this instrumental really describes my life well as an 7w8 so / sx entp . it's so maaaxximmuuum powwaaahhh ! ! ! i'm getting a horrible headache because of this functions vs dichotomies vs stereotypes war . the functions work perfectly and match the dichotomy types if you actually know how they work . the ... the real reason why so many people criticize functions is the harsh reality that most function descriptions are completely incorrect . when handling the function axises , you have to really just read ... caffeine , vodka , smoking ... yeah i have bad habits . as a child , nope at certain points as a teenager , yes as an adult , nope okay , this thread has been confusing . first , i don't believe that an entp can switch judging functions from ti / fe to fi / te . that just does not happen . i have never seen anything which would claim ... in the past months i've learned the hard way that those infjs i'm referring to are actually infps in many cases ( blame keirsey-based websites and mistypes ) . also , it seems that actually intjs get ... same as usual , maybe a bit crazier . though i think i'm less cocky when i'm drunk . but i'm prone to some heavy storytelling and lying when intoxicated , that is for sure . : tongue : i love dancing haha . i rave hard . :p erc 2 : fe thing yeah . i like gossip and gossip all the time . it's fun : laughing : when most people get more honest when they're drunk , you will become even a better liar than when you are sober . : wink : magenta dark blue red cyan violet hinrg and disco from late 70s and early 80s . new music is kinda meh , some rare songs are good tho . for many reasons . also , ne + ti is probably the best possible combo for storytelling in an unique way . i have written 13 books . but procrastination is a b * tch , i gotta say that . i'd still say intps ... 1 . what do you do ? i wash dishes in a shitty restaurant 2 . is your job your passion ? rate your passion out of 10 ( 10 being most passionate ) , and then describe . hell no ! 0/10 3 . were you more ... yeah , it's the most distant judging function for an entp . i know exactly what fi is , but i have real problems understanding it . it's just one plain weird function . i'm an entp and i loathe social media . i don't even have a smartphone . but i'm popular . that tends to be true , unfortunately . well , that is how fi works . it's quite annoying though . as an entp ( fe user ) i don't give a sh * t if a person is authentic or not . what you have on display is exactly what you want to people to see in ... no concerete source , but that's basically plastered all around this ( and other ) sites . i still do recognize that ixxx are almost always socially introverted and exxxs extroverted . - what's your type ?
