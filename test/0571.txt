doesn't that mean you've assumed responsibility for planning the outing ? that's how i would have interpreted it at least . step 1 : leave step 2 : get a gun step 3 : get a ccw permit step 4 : divorce the failure of the marriage is 100 % on him . i honestly thought this was a joke or some weird kinky thing when i ... neutral then amusement followed by a hope / yearning for something more then you need to tell her she deserves better and find friends , family , social workers , etc who will back you up on that . and make it clear that you'll do everything to make sure she gets that . if she's isfj then i can see how she might not have reacted strongly to his proposal which is unfortunate . the appropriate reaction would have been to laugh him out of the room which is probably what ... are you at an age where it's somewhat unusual for your dad to have died though or are you old enough that's it's not really unexpected ? it seems like you didn't make it sufficiently clear that you've ... only when people are taking a picture of me . eh .. not sure how it works when a couple determines a head of the household . i can see someone deciding that their partner is better at making tough decisions and let him make decisions that impact ... i agree . if i didn't want sympathy or didn't feel someone should know that your dad died , i wouldn't tell them . if they unintentionally forced me to mention it like if they ask about my parents then ... that already seems a bit clingy / desperate to me lol ... because you're making it seems like you need him to come . as opposed to just offering for him to join you but if he doesn't , that's fine you can ... clearly the esfj wants to keep looking at dating profiles and agrees to stop and then lies and continues using it because she doesn't want to upset you . it's unclear if that's because she ... i still think i could have a great relationship with her , in terms of what kind of person she is and what kind of person i am . i feel like we click and our interactions are all smooth and comfortable ... my impression of esfjs is that although they can be judging and have their own opinions , they aren't going to be very forceful about them in a direct way since they tend to avoid conflict . they'll ... maybe it has to do with how different types react to each other . so i ( an intp ) is much less likely to push an esfj into a corner where they're going to feel the need the need to push back or vice ... that doesn't really fit with my experiences . are the esfjs you know like that with everyone or only those that are close to them ? just wondering if it's just that i've never been that close to esfjs ... esfj are supposed to be the best match for mbti intp . esfj-intj relationships are supposed to have quite a bit more obstacles if you believe in the theory . best match ( duality ) for mbti intj is ... when an intj refers to that it's hard to tell if they're just trolling by playing up the stereotype . anyways esfj is generally not considered to be the most ideal match for intj so i'd be curious ... are you mbti intj or socionics intj ( which generally translates to mbti intp ) ?
