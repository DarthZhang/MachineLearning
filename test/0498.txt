' hm , interesting . meself not a woman , so sorry for the intrusion and a father to a wonderfull 6 year old ; however , being 22 - i got my child at the age of 16 . obviously it wasnt intended . that said ; ... well , i am very outwards and likable , i despise being alone ( mostly - i also love it ) , and the enfp description fits me pretty much spot on mostly . - - well , i got out of a horrible relationship with my daughters mom like ... 4 years ago i remember that i was ... sad ... for 2 months straight , mostly lying in my bed crying or being somewhat ... just gotta point in and say that i do like some of jbs songs :) having a child 5 years ago is definitly a great thing to achieve :) ( coming from a fellow parent with a 6 year old .. x ) ) but i get your anxiety . being without anything to do is scary ; really scary ... i'm an open book , you'll have to turn the pages but i'm open . ask me and i will answer , i have nothing to hide ; why would i ? course there is that small piece of me that i'd rather not tell , like with ... example of song with somewhat political message that i really love . ouu , what music i enjoy .. that's a though one . i like a bit of that , a bit of that . latly i've been more into jazz , or .. well , jazz with a bit higher pace - not a big fan of the slow jazz .. uhh , ... - - - i actually look at my fingers and count , anything that makes the math more .. visual i guess helps me organise my thoughts indeed . god i hate math . glad i'll be rid of it this summer <3 10physical touch 8quality time 8words of affirmation 3acts of service 1receiving gifts is how i scored on this not a writer but .. i spend most of my time making stories , most of the time new ones , or revisiting old stories , with a new awesome twist . however , if i spend more than say a couple hours on the ... nono ! mine , i need her the most ! i agree with how you're feeling , and i do feel like i'll never be able to fully live my dreams , and it sucks ; it's probably the most frustrating feeling i have . i can't agree to that life feels ... talk to myself and , like you say ; do silly things like sing songs really loudly or dance around like a fool xd i can't stand it either , but i just can't seem to get the motivation to clean :/ really bugs me out mentally . : rolleyes : never met another enfp , or entp , but my cousin is a infp and we're exactly alike . he's more introverted than me - obviously , but aside from that ; we value almost everything the same . almost a bit ... too messy to post .. it's not my room since i live in an apartment but yeah .. too messy to post .. brb , gonna dig a way into the kitchen ! yeah well saying that your views are different than those around you and thus you feel isolated doesnt mean you're better than anyone . it simply means you have no one to relate to . it's quite ... can't really relate to what you guys are saying ; i did my test over at 16 personalities , and the impression i got was far from one dimensional . it painted me as the bubbly fun guy ; but also capable ... quite doubtfull * most * enfps are more introverted than extraverted , and not huggy feely - although , culture and such does make part in that .. well , anyway ; the entirety of the decription of enfp ... well i'm just going to jump in then ; yes , most other types tend to argue with me over the way i view things ; be it morality , or ideas . i usually welcome it ; as getting others views are what i want ... knowing my very lacking ability for responsibility i know i wouldnt ; unless we'd live seperatly ... xd probably way too late into this thread but .. the first half of this is .. aouch realizisation . ouch . ouch . and the absolute last part ... ugh glad i'm not aloe in that x ) i do really think that an enfp , as a parent work better with a partner ; and a partner that's good at keeping rules . : rolleyes : i have a 6 year old daughter , still struggling when it comes to putting my foot down in the regular times . i mean , as you said ; when it really is bad it's not a problem , but when it's something that ... catch the squirrel ! it's getting away ! ! : angry : 16 personalities give me the same result ; basically because , when i'm in a bad mood i don't change any of the values , the questions still entain ; do you generarily ... or do you usually so , but i ... michael pierce is great , but i do doubt it's the best thing to send xd as most people i know atleast , would watch about 1 minute of it and get bored ; he really doesn't have the most engaging voice x ) ... hmm , might check that one out . a big fan of 16personalities , it was great reading about my personality there as it was basically like reading .. me . i'll check out that human metrics though i try , okay ? ! usually i just leave everything in my jacket pockets because i really just can't be bothered .. leaver .. heck if i know where my stuff is speaking of which , probably should find my keys now , considering i'm going out this evening not sure if you mean argument as in argumentation - discussion and debates , or argumentations as in arguments , arguing and fighting ? my answer would differ a lot depending on how you meant ugh , godd you're so annoyin - sorry i can't , obviously it's fine to post here x ) * waves * hello ! : 3 305050 weird , i've always known i was an extrovert , i just didnt know the science behind it and the wording behind it until my friend , a few months back started talking about introversion / extroversion in ... i am currently studying to become a 3d artist . it's what i've wanted since 3rd grade school grade , and now i'm soon in university . it's my dream ; it's that or politics . but i feel politics wouldn't ... writing about feelings are ... difficult indeed ; it's such an abstract concept ; and i view them in such a romanticized light that there does not seem to be enough words to describe them . i'm quite ... imma just bold out things i agree with social interactions x meeting strangers is not my favorite thing , but it can be fun . yeah , well - i enjoy meeting stragners - new people in general . but ... uhhh well , i have different stages of friends . close friends are those that well , that i know is interested in me , and that i can talk open and freely about , without feeling like i'm laying a ... interesting ; for me its ; if they ask , i tell . or if they seem interested . but yes ; 2 people know me for .. me all the deepest thin - not all .. almost all . uhm , usually i don't bother people with ... people tell me to shut it often ; i don't . they have to deal to be honest , if you don't want someone talking during movies then i'm the wrong guy to watch a movie with , simply . / this is why i don't ... oh so it's an old test , i wonder if enfp and enfj are quite alike then ? i can relate to quite a few things ur saying . well , exciting read :) interesting ; me myself have few but good friends . i mean sure , i know a lot of people - that i never spend time with ( anymore ) it's mostly that core group of like 4-6 that i almost always hang out ... finnish neighbor ! : 3 does seem that way , me and my cousin has always been great friends and always connected in a special way , we're so alike in so many ways well , i feel infj and enfp are quite similiar ? i've a cousin who's an infj and we we're talking about our quirks the other night , and we're basicly the introverted / extraverted twin of each other ... i'm either center of attention stupidity , obnoxious joker kind of guy ; or i'm deep in thought and or conversation . either if , almost no in between . depends on the person in question doesnt it ? the only time i'd lie is if it made the person in question feel better ; or if it was a mutual for the better . never to make myself seem better or feel ... ignoring is not something i'd take as a hint ; rather as .. someone ignoring me what i mean by hints is somewhat more subtle . like telling someone off but disguising it in a nice way , blending it ... to be fair ; i myself can't read hints ; not at all . none . zip zero none ; so if someone were to give me shit because i didn't catch on to a hint - no matter how obvious i'd probably be offended and ...
