i was indifferent to zombies before the likes of warm bodies and in the flesh came along and humanised them a bit more . then it got interesting . perhaps because then i related more to the zombies ... i was telling my infx sister how when i was talking to my infj friend tonight he brought up the fact i ' enthusiastically ' expressed interest in drawing comics last week when he told me he used to ... oh , we have discussed it . i dislike the idea of leading anybody on or people not knowing where they stand . we click in the sense we have a lot to talk about so i went on a date with him when he asked ... i feel like all the infjs i know want me to give them something i'm not capable of . for a certain amount of time i think there is an illusion that i'm meeting their needs but in reality we're just ... lavendersnow i find your reply really interesting and you touch a lot on something i've been thinking about a lot lately because this particular infj is interested in me romantically and i think ... these are some really interesting answers and i definitely relate to a lot of them . for me , when i care about something , i'm always approaching it from a ' how can i be productive ' perspective , ... i was talking to an infj about his grandfather . he has dementia and has just been taken into hospital after some falls . he was telling me about it and then apologised for talking about ' depressing ... i have to say that my favourite people to chat to and the ones i have the most interesting and stimulating conversations with tend to be those that i can go even weeks without replying to . sometimes ... if i don't enjoy a person to some degree i probably won't respond . which is a pretty clear message . i do have to say there has been a lot of times when someone has told me something and i either ... obviously . places like this are just a different medium . i use them differently . that is all . i never said i was going to dismiss anyone based on their aversion to sm . i said i was mulling it ... it's not that they never do but it's a different vibe to what i get from places like this . though that could totally be in my head . when i talk in forums like this i'm more aware of others . my social ... ah . i like that social media can be more like shouting into the void than somewhere like this where people are more inclined to reply and then i have to interact . i can be less coherent and nobody is ... i guess you weird me out then . :'D oh , i should have specified i meant my generation . people that don't use social media weird me out . where do they unload all the thoughts they don't want to tell any specific person ? i don't accept that . oh , don't be sorry at all . venting is good . it gets a bad rap but it's actually very important . the reason i asked was because i wanted to know how best to advise you . sometimes i can start of ... the deciding if the date is worthy part . an infj has asked me out on a date and says he has some ideas for a stress-free date . i'll report back when he tells me what they are so we can decide if they are worthy . ( kidding ) i'm like a unicorn . touch my horn ! :p roud : techfreak ah , so rather than advice you're really looking to vent ? i understand how typing everything out can really be cathartic and help process things . if i was to give advice i would say ... why am i irresistible ... :d ry : all i get from this is that you both seem on completely different wavelengths . there's obviously some sort of issue with communication . it's almost like you're speaking different languages . from ... well , he just asked me out on a date . so i guess i did something right . haha . we've only been talking - on a dating website - for the last week or so but our conversations have been like essays ... i ended up making a joke , apologising for the joke , telling them i'm the worst at taking compliments and saying thank you . totally smooth . : cool : he seemed to take it well though . : blushed : i'm not gonna lie . i came here to see if i could work out if i like someone . : blushed : that does sound really interesting and fun ! visiting a stable in general would be something i'd love . getting to pet and feed horses would be awesome . i've been thinking . i think i attract people with strong fe partly because i'm disabled . this is a new theory though , so i'm going to have to develop it . i think you have a valid point and i would find his disregard of a pretty standard trigger hard to get over . maybe i would feel different if it was something very personal to him but i'd still be ... i think in a way we shoot ourselves in the foot with it because we basically poke at someone's emotions and then have no idea - unless we've worked on it - how to deal with those emotions or help ... i guess a big part of it is second guessing myself and worrying that they're feeling more than what i realise or not . so i'm not sure how much of a deal to make it of it . it doesn't help that i tend ... i'm thinking about all the things i could have done today but didn't . all the things i could be doing every day but i'm not . and how i have little to no motivation to rectify the situation . yeah ... how do i break it to them that i don't have any ? haha . that's how i feel too . it's not even that they won't continue to debate , they don't even start them . i mean , i know that i'm right a ... it's a me . : cool : maybe part of the issue with the particular infjs i've been talking to it's under the guise of potential romance and to them , disagreeing with me doesn't make sense when you could potentially be ... that makes a lot of sense and also probably why i'm also a little bit in awe of their intellect . i learn so much from them , even if i might not actually hold on to the information for very long . i ... an infj just told me i was beautiful in a really sweet way ( i don't usually find things sweet tbh ) but i'm not great at taking compliments and i don't know how best to respond . my natural reaction is ... <3 i feel like people need to understand the difference between an emotional exchange and a factual / thinker exchange . the two aren't always mutually exclusive but sometimes they are . i can tell ... ah . in my local shelters you can't really volunteer like that unless you're properly on their books as a volunteer , if that makes sense . you can sometimes walk dogs though , so i guess there's that ... i guess i would say it's not my favourite country . just a country i want to visit most right now . or somewhere i'd like to live for a bit . i took this yesterday when i was still under the impression i was an istp and low and behold i got istp . the results were clear , slight , moderate , clear ... if i remember correctly . it wasn't a ... if someone asked me to an animal shelter on a date i would ask them are they a masochist in all areas or ... ? when you're discussing how you lack the ability to form meaningful connections with the majority of people because you don't find the majority of people stimulating enough ... me : the majority of ... i'm northern irish , leaning towards british . canada ! home of ice hockey and generally just seems like a cool place , plus it's close enough to america without actually being america . yeah , it's this for sure . my overall interest is in writing but what i enjoy writing about or certain topics that inspire me aren't constant . i guess that's where the issue comes in . maybe i just ... i think that makes sense and is probably why the blog posts i'm most motivated and inspired to write are usually the ones that benefit me in some way . usually the ones where i get the warm fuzzies ... i bet that's more common than you'd think . 581906 i'm still working on this . my room is full of unfinished projects that i may or may not get around to finishing some day . i also have a blog and find that i have spikes of motivation and inspiration ...
