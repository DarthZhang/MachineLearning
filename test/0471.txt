( but i do understand that appetite doesn't reflect the body's actual need for food in many cases . ) i always know when i'm ... according to keirsey temperaments , sjs want helpmates . sps want playmates . nts want mindmates . nfs want soulmates . s-types make up ~ 75 % of the population , so it's not unusual that you feel ... omg , ow ... :/ * hugs * hmmm ... i think it's actually the fact that we don't have se in our function stack ? se is associated with sensory details and sports ( and other physical pleasures :p ) and ... omg , you slept for 3 hours ? ? go back to bed ! : laughing : i like how you described being interested in everything because it's all related to people somehow ! i feel like that resonated with me at ... yep ! ! ne is fun ! and you , like , have it in bucketloads ! : laughing : it's kind of awesomely contagious , hahaha . * hugs * : blushed : mine doesn't come out to play anywhere near as much as i'd like . i ... seriously ! who cares ! no matter what i wear when we go out for dinner , my mom inevitably ends up saying something like mm , why aren't you wearing x ? or i think y looks better than that or oh ... omg , i can't keep up with this thread , hahaha ! it feels a little bit like how i imagine it'd feel if i was red in shawshank redemption , and had finally been released from jail only to find that ... haha ! ! i totally know what you mean ! my mom is incredible about house / people upkeep too , she's always asking if i've eaten . she's just so good about stuff like that , and i feel bad because i don't ... my mom is an istj ! and i'm pretty sure my dad is infj . my brother seems like an isxp or something , can't tell on the ti / fi because he doesn't talk much , and just goes school / gym and ... this is what i think too . i feel like this makes us useless to society at large , because what we have to offer isn't what people are going around actively looking for . infps are driven to ... i'm not the best at giving advice , really . but i do know what it feels like to think about all that could be and yet seems so far out of reach , that there seems to be no point in even trying . i've ... that's awesome ! definitely saving it . ^ ^ though , i think it's more to inspire when we're feeling too down on ourselves , than anything to be taken literally . wouldn't want to be too trusting , or ... 1 . intimate one-on-one conversations that go deeep 2 . spending time with a friend that loves and embraces all of my weirdness ~ 3 . that much-anticipated moment when your head finally hits the ... phew ~ ! ehehe :p roud : * hugs * oh man , this brings up what has to be the most embarrassing memory of my life . i was in grade 2 , and had a crush on this cute and charismatic ( for grade 2 anyway ) guy . during recess or lunch break ... hahaha ! : laughing : no way ! your answer was just so awesome and amazing , that it put me at a loss for words . i could only click the thank button and sit back to deeply contemplate the wisdom you ... why do things have to be so complicated ? why can't we get through life without inevitably getting hurt and hurting other people ? why do i feel like i have to think about and pick apart ... yeah , i don't even understand why i'd want to have the upper hand over someone , let alone how to do it . i don't think there's any one specific reason for what we're talking about--people project ... from another thread : i actually don't think most people want to hurt others , barring a few bad apples . i think it's more like , people who are accustomed to go for what they want ( which is not a bad thing , and ... i think we're pretty far down the list as far as assertiveness goes--maybe even at the very bottom . so to people much higher up on the list , perhaps it seems like we're asking to be trampled on , ... i really like they way you've written this ! it's exactly how i feel , only far more articulate . : laughing : i used to think i was an intp , because i confused having emotions with expressing them . i ... i need to go to bed , so i'm not going to address everything you've said . this is not the right thread , anyway . but first , a mental checklist doesn't mean a conscious check list . mine operates ... but how does this work when the enfj makes everyone else feel special too ?

i don't really want to comment too much on your situation , since i don't understand it anywhere near well enough . but the bolded parts stand out to me for some reason . so i'll offer my 2 cents on ... hm , just out of curiosity , can you explain what you do / don't respect in fi-doms ? : x no infps for you then , eggsies . <3 we're level-headed ... after we've had all the feelings . the gut-wrenching intense feelings will fade with time , and the tidal waves will become more like ripples . the thoughts and fears and anxieties and regrets ... will be tempered by perspective . but ... i agree with mollygoround on this one . hyper-criticism , hyper-sensitivity , and emotional distance happen when i'm not feeling respected . something happened that my trust in the person's respect ... haha , it's not quite like that--i don't know how to explain it . : laughing : i'm not illiterate when it comes to tone of voice and body language either . ;) see , even now , because i understand you ... . probably nothing , unless i knew it was reciprocated . really , it comes down to the fact that infps put their hearts in their words . we sincerely mean what we say . so if we're going to put our heart ... omg , so true ! i don't know about anyone else , but if i verbalize any sort of emotional attachment to someone ( and i don't get attached easily ) , it means a lot . so much so that if it isn't welcomed ... i appreciate verbalization a lot , but it's worse-than-meaningless if the connection / actions aren't already there . if someone says they love me , and i know they do , i would feel like i'm floating on ... oh wow , that's beautiful ! ! do people you know in real life read your blog ? i'm just wondering how you work up the courage to write on such topics . ^ ^ pretty much ! ! infps can love and trust very deeply . but we're also very sensitive to the abuse of that love and trust . rather than having fairly constant and immovable walls around ~ 80 % like ... at work : quiet , generally keep to myself , but straightforward and to-the-point when discussing things . i come across as quite serious and rather stoic / emotionally neutral to basically everything . ...
