( i made this 4 years ago . ) i think we heal ourselves , which although true for me , is a bit depressing . seems to be the case for me . until they find out that i'm nice to everyone . without attraction , compatibility and complementary factors become somewhat .. irrelevant . otherwise everyone would be dating their friends . i think he likes you , but may not know what to do at this point . i think infps in general are very cautious about entering a relationship because we agonize on whether we are in the right state to ... that's freaking awesome lol so that's what a happy infp looks like ! people respect you about as much as you respect yourself . given that infps are often self deprecating and have low self esteem , i can see why a lot of people don't give us the benefit of the doubt . ... i'm not driven by desire to succeed or to achieve anything . the only thing that drives me is my quest to be a decent person . this is the only thing that matters in my life . i refuse to partake in ... we definitely aren't the most hated type . i think infps in general can get along with most anyone because of our avoidance of conflict . i will say that infps are probably among the most ... i find that the women that are attracted to me are either the assertive / dominant or the girl that wants to fix someone . neither type i'm attracted to . i don't want someone to think of me as someone ... hey there stranger :P i remember you from when i first joined perc several years ago . i always felt you were cheerful , intelligent , and wise beyond your years . look at the amount of thanks you ... i think i take a lot of risks . i've always wanted to go bungee jumping or sky diving . at that velocity it would guarantee a painless death . in terms of taking risks of the social variety , i'm very ... lol . it's true . i never know what thoughts those female dragons have inside their heads . very mysterious indeed . insolitude i see you have revealed yourself . i'm definitely guilty of this . i think more perceivers are guilty of this , but maybe infps more so ? i don't know , but i know that for myself i am extremely lazy . i want to get shit done , but ... well this happened yesterday after i was stepping out from the mall and into the parking lot , a car drives up beside me , and a lady asks if she can have my parking space . i said sure and proceeded ... i was a very tame child . i rarely cried or threw tantrums . i also wasn't very needy . i remember playing by myself a lot as a kid . i use to have these action figures that i would play with for ... i was diagnosed as adhd a few years ago ( inattentive ) . i have a very hard time concentrating on anything really . even movies i find myself drifting off . my manager also tells me that i daydream a ... i think of myself as shy but other people think i'm pretty outgoing ( sometimes ) . what they do think i am is awkward . i'd rather be labelled shy . stressed , angry , distraught . i feel like i'm doing a good job at work but my boss had put on off track for our mid year review because of a couple of cases that i handled poorly . i agree with their ... i once killed a man . i can see someones flaws and devalue them because of it . the flaws can be frivolous , like if someone says i watch anything , i listen to anything etc . i can project one ... trusting the vast majority of people is not truth though , it's a leap of faith . and well , i actually do love nietzche haha . he was a pessimist for certain , but i appreciated his courage to have a ... i give everyone the benefit of the doubt . it's quite naive and i've been burned in the past , but what is life if you cant trust anyone ?
