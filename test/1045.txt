' addd , my friend , it is like you described my personal story step-by-step . you are absolutely right in every detail . every single one . it is even scary . listen to his wise words , fellow intps , listen ... my previous relationship was with an infj too and everything happened exactly like yours , it was like reading my own story . the understanding / chemistry was perfect and i wonder if i could ever have ... ah , in that case i agree with you . most people ( even famous writers - but fame is not really related to talent ) stick to what is familiar to them . otherwise the world would be populated with amazing ... hmmm ... i think you are confusing some things in this subject , to be honest . of course , it is undeniable that it is easier for any human being to relate to what they already know and that is closer ... hmm interesting . i can see how the enneagram might affect , but it seems she concluded she is not so sensitive , though ? from i read in the convos there , it is not my case at all . i also did not see ... if you want to take this into a debate , then there will never be any proof that anyone existed . the longer ago someone existed , the worse , since less and less evidence will be available , which is why ... i came here directed from your comment on that other religion thread . this is an interesting topic indeed , and one i am exactly studying at the moment . i read some studies on neurology that described ... i haven't studied his workings first-hand , but i am interested in your findings and theories , if you feel like sharing eventually . i understand the analogy with the hypotenuse , but i would have to ... i see it as evolution in the comprehension of truth , and as intended ... if that is what you meant . and as an author , i entirely support this ! i experienced it , but it is a mystery , like so many ... lol this reminded me of something i discussed once , and yes , i agree . he could have created it all at the same time . like when we think a story , it already exists in our mind , we insert and remove ... all christians believe the old testament is full of mistakes , many of those clarified by christ . and yes , i agree . for catholics the whole genesis is more of a representation of the order things ... i guess such mention would sound a little confusing 2,000 years ago . ;) i wonder how being all-knowing works with the future , though . with past and present seem easy to understand , but future ... i believe it is not written anywhere in these terms - the writing mention he is all-knowing ( even the threads of hair in your head are counted ) and created everything . also , his power is limited by ... this is exactly why i think intps are horrible parents . but i've done plenty of bashing in another thread , so i'll restrain myself this time ... are you an enneagram type 9 ? well , either a relationship / something fun to entertain yourself or the getting rid of such crush after you notice he / she is not so interesting . either way , it solves it , unless you like the platonic ... how can that have anything to do with it ? i do not think i am a sexual 6 , at least when i did the test , i got preservation first . still , i'd like to hear your theory . as i said , i give preference to ti , so to what is logical . at least at first . when it comes to judging others . but when it comes to big decisions , i tend to be more emotional ... then again ... to be ... also , i don't know if you saw i changed my answer up there because i noticed it was not very clarifying . whenever my ti and fi clash , i tend to give preference to ti , which is why i work as an intp ... yeah . that probably explains why i am not a very functioning individual ... i use ti for everything in my daily life and decision-process , so i work as a heavy ti user ( intp ) , maybe because i have a high iq and grew up in a rational / academic environment . i just have both ... well , i do not think i work as an infp at all ... i work more like an intp or infj , but for some reason , i have a very high fi . i am always aware of my feelings and i am a very sensitive person . when ... the 2 mbti types that have fi as dominant function are both p ( isfp and infp ) , so there might be a correlation . and this is why i think i am an infp . that works like an intp . :) i do not like to express my feelings so much , though . still , reicheru was saying that acknowledging feelings is hard due to ... i wonder if it is harder for j people ... and are you an fi user ? infp ? btw , i am not saying fi users don't talk to people or vent . lol just wanted to make it clear . to express emotions you don't really have to be in touch with your deepest emotions . you may express the ones you access and even interpret a group's emotions as yours . the opposite is also true ... i need an external unbiased opinion of myself , not marred by the cloudiness of my own psyche . but no one around me is unbiased enough or gives a damn . i wish i could see myself from other ppl's ... i used to have crush on characters so that is not so bad . :P try contacting the person . that is correct too . if you look closely , both are correlated to what you said , usually . hmm , no , not really . that is fe . fi is about feeling a ton of things that no one knows about ... fe ( extraverted feeling ) is more like engaging in the groups ' feeling and expressing it , which is why ... this is less true from my experience . i felt as though i was always conscious of this fact and was too sensitive to her needs . we broke up primarily because she wanted someone to cut the shit and ... hmm if she accepted the idea , it means she really is interested and doesn't want to get you thinking she is not . but we knew that already by your friends opinion . still , her reluctance might indicate ... albeit the second deserves the praise for the effort , both are , objectively , equally good . some may argue that once known evil , the second has more chance to fall back . but it might actually be the ... i really know the feeling . :/ someone woke up with a naturalist literary vibe ... 1 year and you made no move ? no wonder she gets mad at you sometimes and acts coldly . i'd have lost my patience already . so here is the thing : - she may be just playing with you and interested in ... true ... i found quite funny when socrates mentioned this and got to the conclusion that some branches of philosophy are a waste of time . lol hmm i did a lot of traveling and colleging . xd doing both can be expensive , though , especially in the us , so it depends on what you feel like doing . both are great . thank you , i am glad to be of help . i thought it would be interesting to remember that we are all , first of all , humans and individuals . oh , and i kinda like justin bieber songs . in fact , i love ... enneagram is complementary , but hmmm less reliable no , just less descriptive or useful , imo . so familiar ... damn , we intp are cursed . wth do we do with so much thinking ? what are we supposed to do with it ? and worse , how to live with it ? anxiety , indecisiveness and procrastination . haha hear hear . they say entjs are good matches for us , but i just can't see the appeal in extroverts . > . > and you did mention the girl being attractive , so who knows . lol but for most guys , that is ... hmm why ? i think he is too meticulous and focused ... very intj to me . i think jorge luis borges is possibly an intp indeed ... his stories always seemed so ... familiar to me . frame-of-mind speaking . - ___ - ' ' this is what i mean by so many reasons . not to mention that with guys it is always about the looks . being a fairly attractive female , it is better for me to stay away . talking to the guy ... i didn't even remember it existed , probably a very old post ? > . > so you're 6w5 too ? welcome to the freakly distrustful team . :P this is actually my dream come true . > . < wingwoman ? i don't think this term would apply to me , to intp girls and even for girls in general , for so many reasons ... the best way to help a female friend with a guy ( when you have those ... i was indeed agreeing with your rant . even though i understand the wish to talk when you have nothing to say in particular , the responsibility to bring a topic befalls upon those who express the ...
