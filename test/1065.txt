' bump li na ? i think she's an estp . her jokes are very blunt . she ' tells it like it is ' . entps jokes are typically more conceptual . i was thinking enfj too . what type was maya angelou ? entp seems likely to me as well . idk he has that certain interest in peculiar things that i see a lot in infps , more so than isfps . also , he uses abstract concepts very frequently in interviews and in his music . and i think the last ... i think possibly infp but i could be wrong . i don't think scar is like hitler at all . hitler was much more ideological . scar just wants power for the sake of power . i don't see any similarities other than that one scene where the hyenas are ... enfj i think is right . taylor swift ? most of the people on lists of infjs are almost certainly wrong entp yeah , good point , i think you are right . he also seems to have a very fe-like sense of how people should act , what is appropriate . i retract my previous post . jerry is totally not an fe dominant . i see high fe in her . not sure if she is an extrovert or introvert though . i think she is an enfp this has to be trolling . the first type that came to my mind was entj . that's just w / o going into any depth . just putting it in . i can imagine him taking one of those shitty online mbti tests like hmmm , do i tend to use logic over my own feelings ? yes ! ! ! dodger is where i learned about mbti . she has a coffeh time video on it , she's intj . lol wuuut if he is an enfj then i truly know nothing about mbti . i wonder what test he took ? i think pandy is infj . it doesn't seem like he understands mbti very well . lol . it is very difficult to type yourself by letters alone . i think he's definitely an fe user . the person who suggested entp had it right , i ... [ quote = vanishing point ; 3767322 ] so you don't think it's worth re-evaluating if that many people seem to disagree ... i don't have a problem with infps at all . i still don't think tori amos is one . her ... ellen page i watched a bunch of her interviews and i still think entp . though , i don't rule out intp . i just think she is a higher fe user and more personable than intps . i think it's between those two , though ... entp entp i could be wrong but i'm going to say enfp . ellen page an istp ? the two that stick out the most for me are kanye west as isfj and emma watson as estj . entp i'm beginning to think kim is isfp . infj . i thought maybe enfj for awhile but i think she is introverted . i think everyone agrees that she is te dom . however , i am leaning entj . i think she's more intuitive . isfp i think enfp ... eric an infp ? not even close . an infp would be more like hyde . i say definitely istj . he's like the safe , responsible guy . red - istp kitty - esfj hyde - infp donna - isfp maybe infp fez - esfp ? ... ixfp for brad . i can kind of see angelina being enfj . this is the worst thread . anthony fantano ( the needle drop ) is intj , i think . corey is esxj . the guy is constantly butting into shawn's business , it pisses me off . and eric is definitely enfp . am i the only one that thinks infp ? fi dom . i am leaning isfp . his character in perks of being a wallflower is enfp . i voted enfj . i think she is definitely fe . i think he is isfp too . i would say infx . yeah entp . jon stewart is as well , imo .
