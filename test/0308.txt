' generally i would say people are a good reason to be misanthropic . on a more serious level , i personally believe that there is a wellspring of potential in humanity , we sadly , as a whole often chose ... it infuriates me when i actually trust someone enough to make an emotionally involved comment or statement , and they go off the wall . i preface all of them too with how i'm stating my personal ... creating far-fetched crazed theories on why something would never work , and then find out they were always just as crazy as they sounded . the fact that it's not socially acceptable to say this , hey i want to be in a social relationship with you , how should i socially approach you in order to be successful ? i'm reading an emily dickinson biography right now . tmgs 2 and avalon code when i have the time . in no particular order : mushishi haibane renmei bakemonogatari fate / zero steins ; gate kuragehime when people make fun of me for taking everything seriously and wanting a fully detailed report behind every statement they make . fievel goes west . it's a childhood classic ! i'd go with the first . nearly all of what i want to accomplish is helping a other people , so i don't think i'd mind too much . by being a good person by my standards , i'd be able to love myself and i ... unwilling to stand for beliefs or that which makes them passionate . unable to be passionate for anything outwardly . if my death would prevent more deaths , i would chose death . after all , the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . yes , extremely . i'm not the most efficient person out there , as i'm a rather round-about speaker , but at least i try to be efficient . efficient systems and communications are things i consider ideal ... laughably easy exams . contribution i'm over-investing . it's too early , as it always is far too early . yet , i can't help it . i over-invest as a reaction , but that also brings the sincerity of my investment into questionable lands ... i've never experienced anything paranormal , but i believe they're all plausible . you just have to be more forward ! do things the way i do , it'll work for you too ! bionic thank you . i was also curious as to how entjs flirt , if you'd be willing to answer that as well ? happiness is a worthy investment . over-thinking to the point where you irrationally taking things personally . i would consider myself to be apathetic when uninterested . i'm also not very empathetic in general though . not being able to ask other people personal questions . i don't need to sleep , i can over analyze everything and make myself die from stress . i love the themes and concepts , but i think they were poorly delved into . i also didn't really understand any of the character's motives , and when the movie did try to supply them , i personally ... yes , unless i initiated the action . if it's actually going to turn into an argument , chances are there will be little benefit to me sitting through someone emotionally blowing up and not listening to reason , so i'll leave . if i know ... svensenberg if only i had a credit card ! my grand llama herding escape could come true ! i would probably start research into efficient and comprehensive social protocol , economics and social equality . then after a couple decades of research , begin implementing new and improved systems ... i've never cheated , and to my knowledge , never been cheated on . i'm doomed . completely , and utterly doomed . ahahahaha , it's almost funny how doomed i am . i've really no choice but to move to yugoslavia or bury myself in my room forever and never leave again . it's ... how do entjs communicate and approach affection , in both receiving and and giving ? i'm arguing over this championship in another thread with another intp . the group the thread is in has nothing to do with typology . i think i'm wining . i'm mean , i ignore people , and i get over-energized . so in short , i'm pretty immature around people i like , although i'm sure some of this just comes from being young and lacking experience . i tend ... other people responding over-emotionally to a logical , obvious truth . richard i'm ever envious of those who are talented at reading nonsene . vocaroo | voice message ... i'm kind of depressed by the reading selection . the person who i broke up with ( cleanly ) recently wants to ask me a couple of questions . i said that after we broke up , we should have a month without really talking to each other so that way we can ... i'm eating half of a tim horton's chicken salad sandwich , and i wish the break didn't have such a hard crust . i hate to admit it , but that's accurate . i'm probably morally a terrible person though . chaotic neutral chaotic neutral - a chaotic neutral character follows his whims . he is an individualist first and last . he values his own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others ' freedom . he ... vermont kiss ( remix ) - soutaseiriron you have over ten theories on what a person's reaction is to a single question . ayasullivan thank you ! hm , i like sambomaster , base ball bear , do as infinity , kanon wakeshima , some utada hikaru , and aqua timez , is that enough to go off of ? i know two , but i'm not close to either of them . ayasullivan would you be able to link me to said blog , or create a recommendation list for me ? i would really appreciate it . i find it hard to sit down and watch things , so i mainly just listen ... you spend lunch breaks alternating between interacting with your primary work / school social group and researching how to interact and communicate with your social group . when people refuse to be honest about their thoughts and ideas , because they assume that contradicting you will offend you .
