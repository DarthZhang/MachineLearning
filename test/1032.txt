i love loving peope . dear intp , i hope you snap out of your mental state soon .. kinda hurts to see you like that . cheer up . there are more things in life to worry about , don't let a few small encounters bring you down ... i have an intp friend , and the way we think is very different ( haha duh ) . for both of us , the thinking preference is preferred over the feeling . but - . - it feels as if it would have been easier if i ... hey guys ! i think some of you might remember me posting bout going out ( as in literally . not boy girl go out ) with an intp . and you guys said that he might like me and i might like him without ... ah .. i get annoyed when ppl tweak stories / truth or exaggerate so that it sounds more interesting . in short that's lying isn't it . and i don't like it when ppl insult you just to make themselves feel ... i don't get this part about intps . are intps naturally nice or mean . . _ . cause well they can be mean .. but they mirror others behavior , and hope to please people ? ah confusing . and i don't get how ... lol why do you say that ? haha yeah .. perhaps . (: haha nah .. i don't want to be in a relationship with him . i'll like him ( and perhaps confirm this feeling ? ) then i'll see what happens a few years from now . things do change lol . no evidence . anw even if there is .. isn't it super difficult to tell if he even likes anyone .. so i wouldn't know . but from my gut instinct ! he doesn't . hmm .. no not really . he probably doesn't like me . so it's just one-way . the butterflies go on and off . feelings take too much time for me to invest into . but i'm super happy . lol . think the butterflies came back ... lol . that's kinda creepy . i had an esfj friend . really close one in fact ... until he found this other friend and things just weren't the same . i guess his caring / want to make friends with everyone nature was just too ... i think this was written on another thread . how having ' feelings ' for someone is different from having ' emotions ' . perhaps emotions are more tangible ? like you can feel that physical ... woah . you have no replies . haha i think i'll try to answer this ! even if my views are flawed . if it's not official , it could be just you having a crush on the other party . there's really no value to that as it's super ... that's a really good thread . no joke . does my introverted feeling make me very slow to my feelings ? well i don't feel a butterfly woosh thing anymore . so i probably dont like him . freakk .. i really don't know . what does it mean to like someone anyways ? such a confusing topic . sighh .. sorry guys .. i really didn't mean to lie . i just don't know . - ___ - it's really difficult to determine romantic feelings .. isn't it , unless it's official . i thought you guys will be able to understand this better , since you guys are thinkers .. but we don't have mutual friends .. that'll be even more awkward . you guys don't believe me too .. - ___ - that's actually kinda true . if it's not official we're just close friends right .. . __ . i really dont know . perhaps it hasn't registered to me ? nope . it means just sitting there and doing nothing . like a stone . (: thats not true .. i do post on istj's forum . i've stopped my obsession . really think i don't like him now .. ' eddie ' sounds cute . lol . ohh .. i fantasize a lot too . ah i guess i could have liked him before , without knowing .. even with all those factors .. oh i used to obsess over him . but that doesn't mean that i liked him or anyth . so you actually feel a tangible feeling in your chest whenever you see her ? isn't that just like any other friendship ? are you serious ? thats really news for me . i don't even know .. how do you guys know anw ? the butterfly feeling ? lol what ? no ! lol ! i can't solve it in 20s . ill take at least a minute . and it's such a long time since i've played with one . plus it's only the 3x3x3 one that i can solve . xd haha almost every other day . just that we don't talk because it'll mean going out of our way and it's just too intentional . solving is not the difficult part . (: solving it quick is cooler . like in 20s ? (: i thought that it's because they don't even know whether they like anyone .. think we're gonna study together . anw he might suddenly not want to go at the very last minute cause the scenarios played in his head are just too awkward . haha . so maybe we won't meet up after all ... ah i don't know . really dislike thinking about such things .. makes me all confused .. sorry .. anw even if he does like me he'll avoid it . self-denial should be good for both of us . (: i'll bring some rubiks cube for him to fiddle around with . lol . hahahahaha ! . ___ . uh .. if he does like me and i like him .. i guess we just don't know . it usually takes me 6 months after i stopped liking the person to realise it . sometimes i don't even realise ... oh . nono i didn't think that it meant ' i dont care ' . i understan what you've been saying . (: and im hoping that it'll be not as awkward as im imagining it to be .. we haven't even spoken in reality ... what ? . _ . i'm not investing too much in this emotionally .. it's just really awkward and i just wanna meet up even if it gets bad . and i'm really pretty sure we don't like each other . last time i ... ahh maybe he's going . aghhh ! so awkward .. i asked him . he didn't reply . and he didn't say ' no ' either . i think he's dying out of fear or sth . then he went offline . is it that bad .. sigh . the way he thinks is too different . probably entp ? what mbti personality do think rancho from ' 3 idiots ' have ? that sounds nice .. simple ppl . hm . if you were my intp friend . where would you want to go ? oh . sounds good . maybe i can just pull him away from his friends when he's eating . lol jkjk ! ohh .. good point there . i'm always thinking and thinking and telling him my thoughts . does that cause him ... i don't like crowded places too . anw if we were to watch a movie , what do we do before / after that . see ! that's the really problem isn't it . and yeahh i think you're right . he's actually quite ...
