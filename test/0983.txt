hey , how's everyone doing ? so ... i have recently come to the conclusion that i am too easy with giving the benefit of the doubt to people ... i try to never think that a person has an evil intent ... sorry to keep hitting this button again and again . again , i agree with what you are saying . it makes sense . but my dilemma is : only one person showed up . is it possible everyone else was ... i'm the only one who showed up . now , please do explain your reasoning : why , if i was in the group of people who didn't show up , i / we would be at fault ? that's what i'm trying to figure out . i don't know why people didn't show up . but i would agree with the quoted part if more than one person showed up ( say ... if half showed up ) . things is , only one showed up . it is relevant , thanks . let me clarify the situation : there are a group of peers ( read : no one is superior to another ) . a superior assigns a task to be completed by the subordinates ( peers ) , and ... i understand what you two are saying . i actually used to agree with those perspectives , but then i found out that way too many people get offended by what i say . therefore , there must be something ... hehe , yes , guilty of both . hey ya'll ! so ... i need some help . throughout my life , i know to have offended some people by my word choice . sometimes i can help , sometimes i can't . on one recent situation , i was of the ... hey ya'll ! so ... i need some help . throughout my life , i know to have offended some people by my word choice . sometimes i can help , sometimes i can't . on one recent situation , i was of the ... what's so bad about small talk anyway ?

i mean , our expectations ... definitely not . i like to be joyful / cheerful but i have a hard time being so when i'm very tired or stressed . if people were all based on first impressions ... i'd be more alone than i am right now . my sarcasm ( and over-sincereness ) have not conspired well to make me friends . now , i believe i have eliminated sarcasm from my speech . but i find it hilarious when other people do it ! you see , i'm allergic to adorableness :/ check 1:07  the p90 is an automatic weapon . just kidding ! ! i just wanted ... i'd love to be able to ... sense ? how i come across to other people / how do they see me . i'm a little tired of being seen as uncaring and arrogant ... and that as well . so hm , i'm not the op by the op's description fits me perfectly . so ... do you mind if i answer these ?

... mydarkangel that's a compliment hahahaha . seriously though , i've never pictured an entj to be so delicate , yet so ... ferocious with that ... i like to think that , in hindsight , ( almost * ) everything becomes funny . in other words , funny and interesting stories to tell :) * don't go off doing illegal or ridiculously dangerous things , ... i ... don't think pointing fingers is the best way to do it . i'd definitely go talk to an employee of trust , of you have any ( such as whoever handles your training schedule ) . hahhahahhaha awesome job ! ! ! congratulations , you deserved it ! seriously , i'm so happy for you =) hotmustard 632 you do realize my avatar is a fictional character ( impersonated by a person ) , not a person , right ? does the school offer counselor support ? also , i like how you know what's going on with you - what your father is doing - is wrong . because when you become a father , you'll be a great father , ... if a homosexual comes talk to me , i won't treat him / her differently . for example : if someone who is for abortion comes talk to me ( i am against abortion ) , i will treat him like any other person . i ... congratulations on your a ! now , ignore what she said . there's no point listening to people who don't know what you're going through ( or at least don't understand ) . try to focus on doing well on ... i'm against homosexuality because of my religion . i have nothing against the homosexual . in other words , i have nothing against the people who made this choice ; what i dislike is the choice itself . don't see it as change , but rather self-improvement , personal growth . hmm ... in the beginning of this year , when i was literally starting conversations with almost everyone i met ( specially the pretty girls i'd never have the guts to talk to before ) , i felt awesome ... you will enjoy it ! doing silly things normally feels weird at the moment but they never fail to put a smile on my face when i think back about how stupid were the things i was doing hahaha you know , it's not like anyone there will recognize you . you can do a lot of weird stuff and nobody will hold you accountable for that . that's the problem with shyness , isn't it ?
