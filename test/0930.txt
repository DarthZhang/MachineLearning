' i hated gym in school , but i love motor racing . since i could just drive really fast , and not have to work with anyone really . :) what got me more interested in it was car physics though ! i did ... it really is a matter of perception . i lost a lot in my last relationship , lets say thousands of dollars , and time , and even material things . but i gained so much too that is not tangble . i did love ... love is a bit like russian roulette . with 5 chambers loaded , and 1 empty . sorry for being negative ignore me . it is awesome you have found someone , and it seems it was built naturally over time ... seems like others already answered . that was my high school also . except i got tired and dropped out instead . was a huge waste of time anyway . :) for me i would chat more about computers , and ... i think the predictability we see is the observational predictability . when you are actually closer to a person while somethings can be predictable . a lot more of their personality will come out , and ... there is a saying it is not often the trash takes itself out . this is just one of those cases where they were the trash , and they took themselves out . you don't need people like this in your life ... pretty much , no way to tell . if she is intp it is pretty rare when we feel comfortable around someone , so we do take advantage when those situations come up . that doesn't mean they like you enough ... haha no worries . :) i don't have all the answers you seek . more is a matter of opinion , but i will try to elaborate as i see in my own view . so yes schools are part of it as well . there is a high amount of stress from ... you have 27 questions not 25 . but i got 17 out of 27 . so i had to fix it . y - 1 . i am easily overwhelmed by strong sensory input . y - 2 . i seem to be aware of subtleties in my environment . y - ... most of those campaigns to help the poor , are actually campaigns to help the rich . so in a way you could say the poor get nothing almost , and the rich just get richer . so those types of things do ... that is all created by society to label people like this , and make it harder for them than it already is . hence they use a word like dis order like it is something out of order . ( not in the ... only one problem is , it's not a weakness . :) i don't think any person can be 100 % ready . i think that is a false sense of security . at least for me . i have more of a mentality of i'm as ready as i'm going to be . even then it is not something i ... this is in essence what created god and religion to begin with . the idea that everything is just one and there is no us . sort of like the borg from star trek . a collective ... the only difference is ... yeah , i like to refer to myself as a mirror , and i do this unconsciously . i reflect back most of the time what is being given . good or bad . sometimes people might think i'm doing something out of ... yeah , i totally get it . i think the word is opinionated , and that comes across as harsh very often for me as well . people that know me well know that i'm doing it to be helpful , but when it is ... respect has to be earned . so it depends on the context of hard to get there is two types as pointed out already . 1 . hard to get because they like the attention of a person chasing them . ( this is ... i have high standards , but its is not what most people want or look for from what i can tell . even in my limited experience in looking for these things when i tried some online dating . ( what a waste ... hmmm i have a monotone problem . like ben stein . and it makes people angry also . cause they are like why the hell you not angry right now ! you're suppose to be angry . i ... am ... not angry ... it is a trap ! you all send it to me . that sounds like the best plan , because i came up with it . if i had 120k i'd probably pay off my car , and take half into a saving / retirement fund . the rest i would put a ... i have one good friend ... one . i have a couple ' friends i don't really see often . so i don't really know their full value yet . if there is value . so that means i don't socialize much , because i very ... i have a friend of mine that would walk into a computer shop . buy the most expensive pc they sold , and think he got a good pc . 6 months later he would sell the pc to my dad for like $ 200 . i have one ... yeah trying to convince people that don't want to be convinced is a waste of time . so it really depends on the situation . the problem i tend to have is figuring out when they are just pretending to ... yeah that's my problem . i haven't met a woman that is able to fool me like that , and if they were trying they would get kicked to the curb . i even explicitly said : i can't be controlled . if you ... i have given that a lot of thought also . our perception is reality , but what if my perception is not someone else ' perception , and how far does reality bend if that is true . is it only colors ? or is ... for the record , i dropped out of high school . all i really wanted to do was learn physics and math , and science related stuff , but i wasn't allowed until later . you don't need a degree to be ... try to build a business . it is what i did . while it is still very hard , i don't have to deal with anything i don't want to deal with . if someone says do this for $ 4000 , and i want $ 7000 . i tell them ... axe the caffeine before trying to sleep . twitching will go away . :P # 4 . for some reason , no matter how hard i try . i can't fall asleep on my back . so i always end up face planted in the pillow . when i wake up sometimes i'm 45 degree's pointing across the entire bed ... complaining about someone else being dramatic is well dramatic ... so what i usually do is just completely remove those people from my life . that can be hard to do though if you have to work with ... that is probably more likely due to the fact they are older , and have seen more bullshit . the older you get both male and female this tends to be the case . it is not a rush to get out of the friend ... high school drop out . go me ! :) there is another possibility as well . an age gap can come attached with a superiority even as much as 1 year . that competitiveness can be triggered from any age range . is my point . i used that ... a real iq test . it is not possible to answer all the questions . as you have a time limit . to measure how fast the brain works . that biological aspect is usually missing from online iq tests . the iq ... very true . if someone is unhappy they should have the balls to end the relationship instead imo . yeah makes sense , i feel the same way in the other direction . i don't want to feel like i'm a father . it feels wrong . so there is some sort of fine line . why it must be equality . ( and i mean real ... no , i don't think any idea is uniquely mine , usually as you say it is either based off something i heard , saw or even thought of previously that was based on something else entirely before that ... now i want strawberries :( yes , it is possible for us to have a relationship without any attraction from a physical point of view . it is possible we will want to eat your brain for example . it is also possible physical ... what ... i forgot the question it in the distant past . no kidding . i think there is a lot of variables that can shape whether a person lives now , future or are stuck in the past . there is just too ... desirable yes to an extent . for me it is mostly because i do actually want kids one day . so if i go above 37 usually they don't want any at that point . so that is a deal breaker for me . the rest is ... haha i actually once said don't worry i'm only an axe murderer on thursdays . today is monday right ? - just to see what the reaction would be . i thought about adding to it today is monday ... of course it will kill the flow . if you don't care enough to get an honest answer , why bother asking the question ? it is not formal it is pointless . why would i say fine . or okay , or alright if i ... yeah . that's how i think . if you don't like the answer don't ask the question . i'm shawn shitty - people think i'm asshole for saying i am having a shitty day ... go figure . i am suppose to lie and say good . not much , don't really care ( or shrug ) no idea , probably ... i'm going banana's ! now gimme my god damn apple ! if he had feelings it is still unlikely he would do something about it in a short period of time . our type could literally spend weeks analyzing whither she likes me , or not , usually will come to ... usually it is in reference to something they did that was a big deal but not really . so you get a cookie for doing this not so awesome thing a gold medal is a little too much considering what you ...
