' haha . thank you ! you guys have been so nice . :) what type of fanfiction ? ? ? ooh ! what kind ? am i that obvious ? hehe . maybe i should have went with mulan instead . :p :) sorry , look at me , being all rude . i didn't even ask about you ! are you a writer ? younger . i was the eldest child , so i'm trying to write from a new precpective . hence , why he is male . probably just for fun . i would like to better my skills as a writer , learn how to ... oh god , i'm awful at summaries . i'll do my best : eek : currently i'm working on more of a tragedy . it deals with loss of a loved one . the main protagonist , a male , loses his brother in an ... lol . i wouldn't say specific themes . i guess the general attitude could be considered the clich√© finding yourself or getting over tragedy . but there aren't any definite themes . it's kind of all ... yes , i love it ! no you were perfectly fine ! ! nooo ! i was joking ! ! i'm sorry . it was being sarcastic . it was actually adorable . haha . somehow i have a feeling you'll be the one to watch out for . : rolleyes : :p jasmine green tea , and orange spice tea . thank youuu ! i appreciate it . :) thank you . :) but , i don't require such formalities . haha . no , never published . the thought scares me , honestly . : eek : though , i want to consider it . i always thought she was more ixtj-ish ? i don't know . but hey ! if i can achieve disney princess status , ... all kinds ! :) :) i love fictional writing and writing from personal experiences . if it's fictional , i want my ( also fictional / non-existant ) readers to connect with the protagonist . p . p . s . she is ... um . i'm new . and i'm supposed to introduce myself . i'm an infp with a fetish for writing and for tumblr . i realize this is the best place to really understand others types . so , here i am . i hope to ... i see . i appreciate you're reccomendations ! the point of this thread was actually more aimed at research . i wanted to see if we react to certain types negatively because of our cognitive functions or ... so , i may have stalked you for evidence . : eek : but , this is a cute little story that shows that you can have emotional connections and are indeed a logical individual . nothing chaotic here . and it's ... wait ! come back . i meant super ultra macho man ! ! xd i understand that . maybe a little smotherly . but they always have been super kind in my personal experiences . what is it that makes it hard for you ? goodnight ! lets peacefully end it here . maybe , when you don't feel like looking for internet fights , we can ( try to ) be friends ! ^ . ^ now just isn't a good time . i said prove me wrong because my initial statement is what upset you . the statement that says that estp's have a lot of pride . you haven't disproved that point yet . i made statements also that ... i'm still figuring out my own . ;) good luck ! thank you ! yep i'm a newbie . i actually visited it for months , but was too scared to join . finally closed the deal . ha . it's been nice so far . : o despite already getting myself into trouble . :( sorry ! i can imagine an infp doing that though . we act impulsively on emotions . i thank you for trying ! we tend to hide our emotions so as not to bug others , but we don't realize that fact bugs others . xd you can tell by your adorable user pic you're an enfp . ^ ___ ^ what makes them harder than their female counterparts ? not to mention you help scouts , and are married . ^ . ^ someone has to love you then . which means you are nice to someone . hello . your user pic made me very happy ! fyi . ^ . ^ yay ! adorable people are awesome . not manipulation . negotiation . i don't like hurting others feelings and i don't like being accused of something so awful . confrontation isn't a strong suit either . arguments ( unless insisting on the ... are you sure you're istj then ? because istj's are nice . you seem like you could be nice ... maybeee . i mean . you used cartoons and memes . how adorable are they ? but , of course adorable in a manly ... no . i was trying not to escalate the situation . i thought using formal speech would show more respect towards you , as you were the one wronged . i'm not here to dispute the size of any types ego's ... . probably see . you can be nice . ^ . ^ that actually made me laugh . but you see , i'm am infp . i can find a way out . or maybe i'll try the whole puppy - eyed thing . and work on you until you feel bad and save me yourself . i still have ... i am sorry to have offended you . that was definitely not the intention . i genuinely do like your personality type . sure , there are flaws . but like i've mentioned before , i get along with them ... i'm sorry to have offended you ! i know that they come from different backgrounds . we all do . i believe estp's are really cool sometimes . they motivate others , they get things done , and they help us ... there is a big difference in an estp woman and an estp man though . it's kind of a double standard . estp men are seen as irresponsible and stubborn while estp woman are seen as confident and sexy . the ... oops . i see my hideous typo now . let me correct it . * some . and i think we all have a need for it to be done a certain way . mine is that i need it to be engaging and interesting . almost like add ... lol . first off , he is joking around . i only want to be attractive around my love interest . lol . and he would rather be left alone than feared . although , on the rare occasion that he is bored , he ... step away from the elbow . . - . and it's what i know . you argue similiar to my istj friend and i . he actually is currently telling me how he is more attractive . idk . lol . istj do not love chaos . eep . infj's are awesome to me ! maybe ! i can see that . we don't like you either . :-P ( jk i love everyone . ) but yeah , infp was expected . that's true . but they can get their pride hurt easily . then it takes me to tell them sweet words about how great they are . yes , i feed the monster . nah . you're like beast in beauty and the beast . filled with love but you only show the tough side . :P '
