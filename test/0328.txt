' i do the same thing . haha therrre ya go :) haha there's a part of my personality that i'm wondering about . it's the part of me that kindof leaps out of what would be typically me and goes for the opposite . i recently went to las vegas and ... not exactly ... i think we're very very ... self-aware . we're very self absorbed . i don't think we're like the typical narcissistic celebrity who only feels real in the spotlight and constantly ... i would be bad in the business world not necessarily because i wouldn't understand how to maximize money , but because i would choose not to . i would rather operate with integrity and purpose and ... fear : o hahha i never wanted to be a dark infp , but i think i am now . i used to be light , bubbly . i always had this kinda darkness in me that i've been referencing a lot in recent years ... but on the whole i ... the world would soon get the creeping feeling like it was missing something , but wouldn't quite know what . we ( like every other type ) keep everything in balance , and they'd miss the dreamers . ^ ^ also yeah , good point . i used to approach job interviews like i was this sad little slave girl who would nod and panic and agree to whatever they were saying , because i was desperate for their ... you just have to do it and not think about it . ask the rational part of your brain if you have to do it for your longterm benefit , the answer is probably yes . so once you know that , there is no ... i'm walking or standing and i look up and become disoriented , i'm anxious , it's mid-day and the birds are going somewhere and i should get a move on because i'm missing my life and i'm perpetually ... ... that's basically what i was trying to say , hahaha oh and again , i'm gonna reiterate that it sounds like she really * wants * to connect with you in this specific way , but she feels frustrated that it's not happening . that's my opinion on the whole ... my opinion : she really likes you and is bitter that she feels you don't have a natural connection and that you don't intuitively understand her . a lot of infps can't relate just by discussing ... oh , also yeah ! it's a first waking up thing a lot of the time . like when i wake up and i see my pet bunny or someone i love next to me i'm suddenly overwhelmed with love . like i'm seeing them ... i too have those moments . here's a picture i found the other day that kindof reminded me of it : it's scary how we just slip ... i'm totally interested in this , but i'm relatively new and probably don't know what i'm doing . but yes , infps make like ten thousand threads a day and it's gettin out of hand , haha . if anyone ... when i went to prom it wasn't half as draining as i thought it would be . a lot of it was boring sitting around eating and listening to speakers and stuff . then when the dancing finally happened , it ... i don't know . :( it's a very good question . i guess we all get attached to keep us close to the ones we love , keeping an eye on them and taking care of them . and then when they leave we're left ... oh nevermind you're talking about that other stuff . i thought you just meant that you had a stronger intuition than sensing in general , and were also introverted . i was gonna say yeah infps use ... if anything , my inferior function would be sensing , meaning my dominant function is inuition , and since i'm introverted that function would be introverted , making me an inxj i don't ... no relationship can ever work without trust . you need to talk to her honestly about whatever it was that she did or lied about . i've done some pretty terrible things but i've also realized they're ... i have good stories and bad stories about being drunk . good stories : having a laugh , feeling incredibly happy , being really social and actually being the life of the party in moments ( if you knew ... i think displaying emotions is bold and brave , the opposite of weak . hiding it could be considered more a sign of weakness , if you think of it that way . but everybody deals with things differently . i haven't , but my dad has done a few things . he doesn't make a living from being just an actor , he pretty much almost never acts anymore . he was mostly in plays and a couple of commercials and ... i think there are definitely borders . as infps we're especially driven to feel connected to the real core of others . we can get along superficially with people if we have to , but we don't bother ... hahaha i read the first 5 words and burst out laughing . i'm very cat . pffft , oral sex is the bomb . i write for fun / release . my writing is sometimes good , sometimes terrible . even if i had the ability to , i don't think i'd become a professional legitimate writer of any sort ( even though i ... we like holding onto these feelings because they're exciting and give us drama and something to do with our time ! you have a big ol crush on him and that's super exciting - until stuff like this ... yes we do . we're idealists and so things fall short in our eyes a lot of the time , but we can't go on like this forever and so sometimes we find ourselves wanting to want something . and ... no dream , no purpose . 25 years old . no idea . i'm only ever like this if i feel there is an unbalance between our affections . if i feel i'm more interested in him than he is in me , holy shit . do i ever become a psycho . mostly ... oh i have another one - go to a totally foreign and borderline dangerous country all alone no desire whatsoever . okay well maybe some desire . but not worth it . i'm too scaredycat . - go legit skinnydipping with a bunch of people ( i've only half sorta done it ) - fall in love again - get married - learn to play a song on guitar - paint something nice - make someone i have a crush ... opposite of a bucket list , this is a list of things you actually never want to do and have no interest in doing . a few of mine : - skydiving - bullfighting - doing hard drugs - mountain climbing ... seattle peeps ! i live nowhere near seattle but i recently visited there . it was awesome . :) me and my friend ordered pronto pizza to our hotel room ... and whatever that pizza place is that also ... i'm getting chills just reading about them . i'm remembering all these little snippets of scary things from when i was little and stuff . oh god i'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight . dear ... what the fuck that happened to my brother , too . hahaha ... i don't think it's abnormal for people to dream about slightly similar dream people ... i've had lots of interesting guides in my ... as soon as i utter a phrase my sincerity dies , becomes a lie whose coldness chills me . she's saying she feels the desire to reach out , to be understood . but the moment she does ( speaks ) , she ... apparently this is not uncommon ! that being said , i have no idea what it is . but if you google vibrating sensation sleep or similar words , you get a ton of results for people experiencing the same ... i'm sorry but i can't really tell you anything . :( other than when i first tried sleeping on my back it would give me nightmares . every time . not as much now . i wake up in panicked states ... i don't know , i'm having a lot of trouble with this the past couple of days . i'm not sure what triggered it , i think perhaps a lot of reading about carl sagan and his wife and a quote by her that is ... also , give yourself time to get ready whenever you're going anywhere . wake up extra time , have a nice leisurely breakfast , and don't always be rushing and stressing yourself out . i know it sounds ... i would just give myself some perspective and then if i still want to be with him when i'm thinking clearly , then i can crawl on back to him . but at least give yourself the chance to distance ... well this doesn't surprise me at all . exactly my hand , exactly fitting for an infp , most beautiful but unfortunate hand ... yeah that all fits depressingly well . hmm , maybe . i was with someone for 5-6 years and it didn't wear off , but i can definitely see like , married couples not experiencing that same level of mental commitment . : depressing . re-reading your original post i see now that your main issue is just wanting to find someone like that already . you seem like you've made your choice about waiting until you feel a certain ... for the sexual urges , just masturbate if you don't already . honestly . and for the fear of being alone , no you're very silly , you are not going to be alone , trust me . as for the rest , i would say ... well i'll just delete this post because apparently it is not even a little bit relevant ! i thought this conversation was going to go a completely different direction .
