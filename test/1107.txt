' i'm skeptical about the ( dis ) integration of wings and tritypes . wings just inform the main type , and i'm not sure it makes sense that they integrate separately . i feel the same way about tritypes . i ... well do they ignore you when you try to help them out ?

sent from my iphone using tapatalk - now free absolutely yes . once my mind is racing it can take me an hour to fall asleep . i think your issue is that you are trying to understand it ! i appreciate you guys . one of my best friends is an entp and he is really prototypical . you are probably our biggest rivals when it comes to being charming , so there's some definite respect there ... we are really good at finding silver linings when we look for them . i will tell you i've known a couple unhealthy enfps who very consciously decided not to look on the bright side and they became ... i totally understand . us enfps are interested in way too many things ( if that is possible ) . my suggestion is follow your gut into one of these many fields that suit you , and try to branch out to do ... are you following me around ? :P edit : to muchaparadox that is haha i use te mostly when i am leading something . in particular for me , leading a group of musicians in learning / performing a song and arranging the parts is its most noticeable use . doing this has forced ... i for some reason really feel like answering questions at the moment and while this may change at any time , i have high hopes that another enfp would take over . all enfps should answer questions on ... regarding my ability to read words backwards really quickly : i think at birth you gave up certain social graces for this ability . – esfp friend i am pretty positive you are a p . if i were to type you from what i know i would guess intp . but that's just me , i don't know you at all . i suggest getting other opinions and reading a lot of ... it sounds like your tidiness is more out of practicality ( a t trait ) than it is out of j-ness ( couldn't think of a better way to say that :P ) . here are some go-to questions i have for p / j : how ( if ... yeah see for me my most developed is fe but by mbti standards i should be ne . dominance and development seem to be different in functions . sent from my iphone using tapatalk - now free what you are describing sounds to me like fi which is your tertiary function , and it may just happen to be more developed than it might be for other intjs . in theory , any of the eight functions could ... i gotta agree with swordsman here , theon's definitely a 2w3 . his disintegration to 8 is just too textbook . probablylumpy please :) i have no idea what to tell you but here's some general advice . live your life and be happy and if something's stopping you from being happy get rid of it :D :D :D :D :D :D :D probably just deep psychological issues ... nothing to worry about :) well i felt i had already answered one so :P ! ! ! hell yes i fought / fight with my sibling . he's a little prick a lot of the time . i love him but he just pisses me off and i can't help but try to ... wow is that ever an intj question . how is people really loving your personality an issue lol yes the couple of people who hate me hate me for absolutely no reason . generally once they get to know me that goes away . except for my ... first of all , dmb is still really damn good so don't give ' em up . there was a great moment i had while writing a song earlier today where i kind of hit the wrong note on the keyboard and it ... istj mom , infp dad , i'm an enfp as is my brother . strange that my mom is my opposite ( or anima , whatever you call it ) . actually two or three of my best friends are esfps . one of them just got really drunk for the first time this summer and he started really opening up . by that i don't mean expressing his feelings ... fyi this is less about getting answer to the question than it is about just hearing funny stories in relation to personality types . so i don't drink , but i was wondering what the effects of alcohol are on different personality types . this could be very entertaining so i wanna hear stories , both personal and about others . :D it is very emotional , that's for sure , haha but i meant more lyrically . like this : i guess when i say sad songs i mean more like emotionally purging songs . if you know any counting crows songs , they're one of my favorite bands . my latest favorite one is if you were jesus i would totally follow you . makes me feel ... like jesus sorry , love sad songs :) god do i ever . i feel like every relationship i've ever had has been ruined by opening up too much to people . that's probably not even remotely true but i think i might tend to scare people away by ... apparently i'm very good at it , and i don't really try . i think that's common among us enfps . i just love flattering someone and making them blush . i feel really good when i make someone blush , i ... that's funny . another thing , it now seems really obvious why my parents recently split up . neither infps or istjs really share their feelings — the difference being infps tend to keep them boiling up ... i certainly relate to my dad more , but my mom and i complement each other very well . interesting how similar our situations are . :) it's true that those are hugely different relationships but it's ... grew up christian , so i am still christian . i don't think if i grew up muslim i would have become christian , because i really find religion to be hugely unimportant in terms of faith . if you are ... i just did the test on my mom and dad the other day . i'm an enfp , my dad is an infp , and my mom is an istj . my dad and my type relationship makes perfect sense because we're pretty similar but i ... yesterday i came to the realization that probably my two closest friends are both esfps . is this fairly consistent among you guys too ? it's very interesting , thanks again ! thank you ! it's just a girl i'm interested in . from what i've picked up she's an esfj . that is for me , an enfp . i've heard bad things about some people's interactions with esfjs . i know relationships differ for everyone and the mb type doesn't cover all the little things but i'm just curious . thanks ! ehh rationals are boring :) from what i've read on entps it seems like i would be in arguments a lot ... and i do not like arguing .
