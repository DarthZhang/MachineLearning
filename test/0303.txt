' i just rewatched this movie ( the full movie is posted for free on youtube ) and i'm curious as to what you all think of the characters . toaster - infj - in the very beginning of the movie , i ... well this was a very interesting exercise , but unfortunately i couldn't use it at all to help determine my type . i mean ... it asks you to describe why you feel the way you do and what made you decide ... intro ( you may skip if you wish ) so for years i've seen my brother as a fe-dominant type . fe just describes him 100 % . he is just so people-centric , sentimental , loving , etc . that it fits him ... am i weird in that i don't like the feeling alcohol gives me ? i know a lot about who i am , what i like and dislike , what i'm feeling in the moment , etc . i just can't relate much to mbti . surely it is not that strange to not be able to identify with such ... haha . well part of the problem is that ni seems to defy explanation . how can i relate it back to myself if it can only be defined in the most extreme abstract sense ? well , i'm definitely not ... i'm not really sure where the sj traditionalist stereotype comes from , to be honest . maybe kiersey only looked at elderly sjs ? oh and don't get me started on te being about organization . sheesh ... yes and no . yes , because question 15 in your post is highly indicative of 5 . no , because that is the only thing we have to go off of , so really , i don't know . enneagram seems to be about ... heh . i am exactly 20 actually . what i mean is ... i'm far more apt to ask to help others than many people seem to be . i would think this would be more of a fe thing . see , this is where ... hey there ! i have always felt that i have more si / ne than se / ni , but i wonder if it's just because people have such a hard time describing ni . do you feel that you understand it ? perhaps you ... heh , it's funny ... when i first started learning about mbti , i was torn between istj and isfp . i have entertained the idea of being a shy extravert , but i have eventually rejected it . i hate the ... do you want us all to fawn over you ? this sounds more like a humble brag than anything . i has a sad now . :( well , 1 and 2 are more in line with stjs than sfjs . specifically , 2 sits kind of in the background , but will start acting like 1 if no one is there to take the lead . however , if you said that you ... when i sneeze , i clamp my nose and mouth shut so spit and / or mucus doesn't get on anything . it has never stopped a sneeze . i'm not really great at typing others , but i just wanted to address this . i really have no idea why people see the keys 2cognition test as the be-all-end-all holy grail of cognitive function tests . ... hey guys , so i saw the sticky saying that chat was removed . i remember it when i joined eons ago and it stinks that it is gone . however , i was wondering if the forumers here have an alternative ... are you saying that i'm either an se-dom ( esp ) or si-dom ( isj ) because i'm so positive on sensing ? or are you saying something else ? sorry , i'm a bit confused . hmm ... i will say that my views ... i got rluen , which apparently correlates to istp . however , e vs a ( t vs f ) was super close ( 44 % ) and u vs o ( p vs j ) was somewhat close ( 42 % ) . i feel like i've taken this before with the same ... work before play . i do the opposite and it's really terrible how much i procrastinate . i can't see any downside unless you're a workaholic ... in which case i don't understand you at all . :P hi guys . i joined this forum years ago and participated for a bit before dropping off the face of the planet . in the short time i was here , i inquired about my personality type and couldn't come up ... i'm really tired so i don't know if i did this right ... enfp e - 22 n - 50 f - 12 p - 11 well , let me start off by saying that tests don't personally know you . personality tests are simply made for you to get a rough idea of what your type may be . the rest requires introspection and ... tests don't really know who you are , making even the professional ones that you pay for not always accurate . have you tried looking at functions ? if you are in fact an ep , then se or ne is your ... heh . just interesting is all . : laughing : hmm ... i've never seen fe described that way before . it kind of makes it seem like fe just follows the crowd and i'm not sure that i identify with ... ahh ... bingo . very interesting post . thank you . i've always identified a tad with the avoidant personality disorder ... hmm ... this is a difficult decision ... i'm not sure which i use or ... i'm getting some sort of etj vibe here . you seem to use te a lot , but i'm a bit unsure about your s / n . got any details you think might help with that ? woah , thanks for the response . about fe - it's not that i don't want to give others negative energy or whatever , it's that i really have no desire to share my emotions with other people and i ... okay , let me start of by saying that i've been here before . it's been a while , and i've left a couple of typing forums for a while . it wasn't for any particular reason ... i just lost interest . ... i dunno , you sound pretty n to me . i think more ne than ni , but i'm not very certain . it's funny how a lot of people just assume they're n , i've always been the opposite . : tongue : do you relate ... yeah . it's funny because i try to tell this one friend of mine not to care so much about what other people think when i know that i care too much also . the difference with me is that i do not ... well , i dunno . 1 . it gives me something to think about . 2 . when i first thought that i might be an sj , i got really angry . i think it was due to the fact that it is common , and i didn't want ... well , people typically go in groups to this sort of thing . some have dates , but most people go in groups and party with their group . if i go alone , i'll just be standing there in a room full of a ... uhhh ... not really . thanks for responding though . :/ well , i have somewhat of an issue . the homecoming dance to my high school is coming up this weekend . last year , i was surprised and this random group of people asked me to go with them . we were ... i'm leaning towards intj . thought so . case closed . haha . these are great . me please ? let's say we have a subject named bob . whenever bob goes and socializes with his friends , his mood and energy levels change to match his friends ' mood and energy levels . so bob goes over to joe's ... i am about to be sleeping . ' night . i'm doing yet another project . i set it to start playing whenever you view my page . * evil grin * after some more consideration , i've changed my mind and i think my mom is an isfp . i don't really think so . my parents are both introverted and ... well , i think i'm introverted , but i'm not ... i've never taken the official test , but i have taken numerous online tests . the first time i took one ( when i had no knowledge of mbti and therefore no bias ) i got istj , but i wouldn't say that this ... maybe so , but i think that it mainly shows that people should not think that they are limited by their type . everyone uses all of the functions , but mbti shows what they prefer to use . i think about a lot of things just for the sake of thinking . it's usually not about what i'm about to do , but about a lot of random things . i may be thinking about what would happen in a certain ... i just had some ice cream so i'm in dessert mode . : tongue : what causes thought ? how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood ? yes . done . he is an eyqp .
