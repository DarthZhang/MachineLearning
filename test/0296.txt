' if she was really an intj , she would be able to read celestia's mind much better . she's always wrong on what she believes celestia wants from her . wouldn't happen if she was a ni-dom . so an infp ? just going by the movie since i haven't read the books . katniss - istj she's pretty much textbook istj . peeta - isfj johanna - enfp what is your myers briggs type ? infp which are the myers briggs types you are most attracted to ? esfp , enfp , can't decide between estp and isfp which are the myers briggs types you are least ... i would suggest hanging out in smaller groups if you have a bunch of introverted friends . around three is ideal and they can be themselves more . in larger groups , they tend to shut down and shut ... intj and intp - they might be tricky but they suck at fighting ; keep your eyes on them and stab them the first chance you get ( preferably in the middle of a lot of activity so they don't have time to ... pfff ! infp here . i don't get attached to people easily . estp - good at fighting and sensing danger but isn't very far sighted istp - basically estp but with less charisma entp - their ... no need for personal attacks . also his association of harry to james is a sign of unhealthy si , not ni . :d ry : maybe you should look up the differences between the two functions because you seem to ... that's seems more like unhealthy inferior si to me . unable to let go of the past and his old feelings . he's neither and intj nor intp . behavior is not indicative of personality type . feelers can appear quite cold and unfeeling if they're not fe-doms . the way that he lashes out at harry ... most of his choices and decisions comes from how he feels about things so i would have to disagree . unless you can show examples of how he's a ti-dom , i'm not buying it . infp's and intp's can look ... he's an infp . he doesn't act like a failed intj . his irrational dislike of harry stems from his inferior si . harry invokes those horrible memories he has of james . he's stuck in a fi-si loop ... how is he effortless with fe ? he seems to be very awkward and uncomfortable in social situations . fe people are the ones giving hugs and kisses and butting into conversations effortlessly . lt is ... i thought jasmine was estj . what makes her an entp ? i think he's an intp . his logic and reasoning seems to be ne + ti vs ne + fi . his mannerisms also come off as a thinker to me . tywin lannister entj cersei lannister estj jaime lannister estp tyrion lannister entp joffrey lannister crazy eddard stark istj catelyn stark isfj sansa stark esfj arya stark istp ab because they're my initials . my first impression is estp as well . i see a lot of se and ti in the way she analyzes things in her reviews . also , she's definitely not a feeler . they only pretend to care about others . unhealthy fi might not care about you , sure , but at least they won't pretend to . infp's , isfp's and istp's will take it to the grave . infj's are terrible at keeping secrets and i'm not sure why exactly . they just seem to like to blab about everything . estp's are also ... imo : enfj - the only thing that really matters to them is themselves , never trust them . entp - they're born without empathy . never trust them either . we're laughing at you , not with you stupid esfp . i think he's an esfp . his hobbies are pretty se , catching jellyfish , blowing bubbles , making crabby patties , etc . when he gets angry he makes cutting comments that are surprisingly accurate which ... yeah only ni-doms can come to that conclusion . : rolleyes : ne - you make connections about the world around you ; the people , the events , history , etc to form conclusions ni - ni is harder to explain but it's like solving a mystery through seemingly ... i'm sorry but that's a really stupid statement and shows how little understanding you have of the functions . feelers can be extremely evil and manipulative and insensitive to others . in fact , ... he's like the polar opposite of an istj . doesn't stick to traditions , does what he wants and doesn't consider others , doesn't value rules or traditions . entp - wants to be loved enfp - wants to be accepted they won't admit it but it's true . tywin lannister entj cersei lannister estj jaime lannister estp tyrion lannister entp joffrey lannister crazy eddard stark istj catelyn stark isfj sansa stark esfj arya stark istp ti works like a calculator . isfp . that's not extraverted intuition . don't go by the vague descriptions online because they're usually wrong . anyone is capable of considering possibilities but that's not the same thing ... i'm leaning towards isfp since alot of your facts jump out as sensing to me . what are you like when you're stressed ? do you tend to lash out and become agressive or are you cold and calculating ? i lie to people who are too nosy . i have to rehearse the lie before i tell it though . intj . as a teen he wanted to rule over people for their own good . if that's not extraverted thinking then i don't know what is . i second buddhism , not necessarily the religion but the way of thinking . i also meditate and go on a trips . charming - someone with good social skills and is easily able to make others feel comfortable around them i'm not charming . lee yun-sung : estp kim na-na : istj i love college . i like learning . college makes me feel ... inspired . it's not foolish unless you're a nickle looking for a dime . do you meet your own standards ? probably isfj's . i find them the most unnerving since no one can be that nice . * shifty * you need to set attainable goals . e . g . join a volunteer group , donate money to ___ charity , etc saying something vague like i want to help thousands of people is not a goal . if it's such a toxic environment , why would you even want to stay there ? i would start saving up and plotting my escape asap . if you can't afford to leave then stay there and bear it until you can ... i don't care what idiots think and you should too . lure them with vices until they become fat and dependent on your products and then do whatever you want i like nt's because they be sayin what i be thinkin . ( but in a much more logical , concise way of course ) if he's an entp , he must be a very good actor indeed . i was very agressive and domineering as a younger infp . i had only developed fi and since te is our inferior function , it can make younger infp's quite agressive and rebellious . there's a lot ... intp's simply don't make very compelling characters and are hard to relate with . they don't make good villians either as they're not very driven in things that most people would deem important or ... fi is like a deep well of feelings and beliefs . infp's interact with the world through ne , so it's harder to observe fi in infp's . you can probably observe it more in enfp's . in infp's , you'll ... i love this movie ! rancho - enfp raju - isfj farhan - ? pia - estj prof . virus - intj '
