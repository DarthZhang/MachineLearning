( i want to take a shot , but i am too tired at the moment . will edit later ) most of the time it goes without saying :) . i have begun to realize , though , that common sense can be sacrificed if it needs to . i can't always explain why i do something if i feel i should do it . no ... hmmm . i love the feeling of accomplishing something out of the ordinary that i have wanted to do , but that feeling fades as i look for a new challenge . i love listening to music of all sorts , but it ... at the moment , i have no clue so i wasnt really sure how to describe the whole thing before , but i stumbled upon an article that mentioned the idea of a false self . if you dont know what it is , google it . it is by far the ... the conflict avoidance is more conditioned than anything else . the problem that i seem to have is that so many of my behaviors are behaviors that feel out of character for me , but i have done them ... like i said , lots of uncertainty . i struggled for a while even to figure out what type i was . for a while i was istp , hence the unchanged signature , but there are certain aspects of that type that ... i have been talking to a psychologist for a couple of months now , i suppose , and while it seems like some things have been made clearer for a lack of better words , i am still confused , for an ... i recently started journaling if you will , and over about 3 or 4 sessions , i have roughly 16 pages ( double spaced ) of text , its a stream of consciousness setup . its interesting to go back and read ... i'll go with that for now question : could an isfp present as an istp if they were emotionally walled off for a long period of time ? lately i have been doubting whether or not i am an istp . as far as my feelings are concerned , ... question : could an isfp present as an istp if they were emotionally walled off for a long period of time ? lately i have been doubting whether or not i am an istp . as far as my feelings are concerned , ... i'm kind of in a similar process , i am what my signature says right now , since i am in a more settled state of mind , but i am double checking on my actual type . i think i will actually go through ... as a kid , the one movie i can remember crying to was an animated movie called the seventh brother . ever since then , marley and me almost did it , but not quite . the uk version of skins almost had me ... i think my rage is more of a long smolder than explosive . i suppose i burn it off so to speak , as it gets poured on . even with something like anger , it still gets weighed risk vs reward in my head , ... so i have heard this so many times , but what does it actually mean to give a piece of yourself . i think that i would be willing to try it , but i really don't quite get it . in my book , its right up ... i am , generally speaking , not like i used to be in my opinion . if i had followed the path i was on undisturbed , then i would probably be more extroverted , would feel more than i do now , would ... to me , teasing gets very old , very fast . i have yet to actually snap on anyone for any reason , but i have had some pretty violent urges , but never been pushed far enough to act on it . its the whole ... so it turns out that my attitude problem was my being right . i was so negative because i really got some bad vibes off this certain individual , and when opportunity knocked for them to screw up , they ... dark humor , dumb humor ( sometimes ) , and offensive are usually the criteria that make me laugh , sometimes clean humor works as well , but it has to be pretty good . i'm told that i have an attitude problem , yet nobody has actually been able to tell me how to fix it . apparently the very few times that i actually open my mouth to question somebody ( with the honest ... i totally agree with you on the being as straightforward as possible , but i feel like if i live my life thinking that it's everyone else that's weird , then it will compromise my judgement and limit ... nvm , too much over analyzing ( i had a quote and response here ) if only being an istp were easy . it's like we are both some of the most complex people on the outside , but on the inside we have some of the most simple and pure motives possible . it's going to make ... yes , it seems that people understand that the istp has the treasure because they have seen it , but eventually they find themselves locked out again . edit : i guess it's just more an observation ... i just had another thought . even though it's been established that istp's have some super secret treasure locked up , it seems like accessing that treasure is a continuous battle . do you ( you meaning ... this is why istp's will always continue to fascinate you enfp's .
