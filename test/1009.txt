' what they put in children's food ... delicious ! i agree , but we cannot change that i don't know if your opinion regarding vaccination will change once you have children , but i figured you don't have children when you said this ' i'm good . if you're too weak to survive by genetics ... yeah , i think it's common sense that if you make a vaccine that you deem safe and helpful for human kind , you should be the first to test it , so producers should be the tests for everything they ... do you have children ? don't worry , i haven't taken anything personally . about vaccines ... well the issue is always going to be complicated . i remember a time when vaccines were safe , when noone knew anyone with side ... yes we all die in the end anyway , but it makes a big difference if you die at 30 or 40 or you die at 90 . so that's the thing , even foods that used to be safe are now not so safe anymore ... carrots are ... yeah , that's the thing . food makes a lot of sense too , but look what's in it . i don't know ... i'm just skeptical about vaccines as well , that's all . it feels like i have to choose between maybe ... yeah , food makes sense too , but look what's in it . i am just skeptical that's it . i vaccinated my child all the time praying there would be no side effects ... i'm somewhere in between pro and anti regarding the vaccines . i think that vaccines actually worked in the past , but putting all pieces together , seeing how the world is developing , it just makes me ... good luck , work on them and be happy ! ;) i am really really sorry to hear that , of course something like that would make you build barrier after barrier . i imagine you already went to the psychologist ... i was trying to think what to ... thank you , your post is very helpful and i will try it :) i've felt like i missed being around people a lot and then when i got around them i felt like it was no big deal , not many were interesting , therefore i started looking for the interesting ones and ... well , this depends on what you believe , i believe i do value life , but there is the afterlife that is more important that this life , so i actually make the choices i think are best for the afterlife ... don't know about you , but i used to react a lot to people's actions and take things personally , instead of acting and driving things where i wanted them ( sometimes this also meant knowing when to ... i agree with your explanations and actually part of them i tried to explain previously , but maybe didn't make myself understood well enough . anyway , i think we can both agree that no matter what they ... :) ) ) very funny ! ! ! nice , just an advice from my own experience : be prepared to run into the same problems even with the person you want to be around you and enjoy you , because the problem will appear and re-appear ... here is the problem , you see an or , i see an and . what i mean is : you say they both live in their respective houses or they both burn to death at the same time . but i don't see how can they ... ok , so my theory is to extrapolate this to the whole population and the answer we get is the answer we use , but for simplification reasons let's assume there are only 2 people oin the world , noone ... please give details over the risk , survival and players involved . why would everyone be on their homes alive ? i don't understand this . if all people were given the this choice , you have to be the freezing person in another person's scenario . so if all chose a ... actually , i was thinking about it and in your scenario with the house , it's not that important whether we live or die . i mean , if all chose the house , we all die , if all chose the person , there is ... well actually in your scenario , none of us would die because the burning house would actually help keep us alive or we keep each other alive . also , if everyone on the planet were given the same ... i'm saying it doesn't ever make sense to choose anything material over anything non-material . it seems like a small choice , but what if 7 billion people were asked to do it and all chose the same ... the question is regarding life vs material things ( money , art etc ) , i think we can agree on that . so what you're saying is that if you take sentiment out , sentiment that is actually love , life does ... your argument sounds like when removing the sun from the solar system , uranus is more valuable than earth , but none are valuable without the sun because there is noone left to assess that value . so ... i take things more literary , you don't know whom it belongs to means that you actually don't know . he could be anyone except your child , so it doesn't actually remove any possibility of him being ... true , but it doesn't mean he / her can't be your relative . he / she can be your nephew / niece / little brother / sister for example or the child of a very close friend , since you don't know anything about ... so funny , but not if the child randomly chosen is yours . the people who've done that documentary have a lot of spare time i think . if you look at da vinci's photo it doesn't look much like that of mona lisa and even is let's say by any strange correlation ... of course there are many sides to a problem , but i think the best way to know the solution is to take it step by step , i . e . solve the low self-esteem problem and see if there are any others ... negatively . i'm also dealing with low self-esteem and trying to improve it . i've been afraid of taking initiative sometimes and stepping up when i felt like it , so i'm trying some techniques to improve it , such ... you're quite interesting and it seems like you had a major disappointment in the past as if something happened with someone dear to you . i think the point in having long-term relationships is ... if it's a self-esteem issue , the good news is that it can be solved easier that personality type issues :) . self-esteem can be taught and raised to higher levels for sure , you just have to work on ... :( :( who's gonna cure me now ? :( :( :( i'm sure your country needs you too and hope you go back after uni . change before it's too late ! keep your option open , if you can do 2 at the same time , it's better ( at least for one year ) , but change while you can . accounting , though i regretted the choice . now working in the planning department and it's better . ok , so basically you guess what they are by what they do . ok , that i can try to do . i thought that maybe people in other places are more open about this and they kinda tell each other , because this ... i keep wondering how most people in this cafe know the personality of the ones surrounding them in real life . i mean , in real life i can only guess the personality of the ones around me , like work ... is it possible that this has to do more with your self-esteem than your personality type ?
