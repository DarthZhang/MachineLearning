' two things . 1 . i want to leave planet earth and live on another planet to escape all the bad crap in the world like evil dictators and society . 2 . i get really pissed when i find out that i ... i'm 19 . i'll be 20 this year . i feel like this is when i'm starting to buckle down and be like ok time to face reality and get shit done . i'm gonna apply for a job this spring and then maybe in a ... wow i have not been here in forever . lol . but i completely relate to this . i'd love to just drop out of bullshit society . sometimes i wonder if that feeling will ever go away . not that i want it to ... night owl . it's quiet and no one else is awake . i like being up when everyone else is sleeping . i've never done it but i'm quite curious . lol . i do the same thing . i get so obsessed and then it fades away . doesn't go away entirely . i just appreciate it and put it on the metaphorical shelf next to my other past obsessions . and it's ... my friends say that i talk with my eyebrows . lol . i'm always suspicious when someone attractive flirts with me , which isn't very often . it's flattering , though . and if i do get straight up offers , it's from guys i don't find attractive at all . i ... kind of weird . i also had a lot of male friends . i loved reading books and writing stories . i loved the library and i still do . lol . yeah i can be kind of paranoid at times . i like the energy of parties . i kinda just like to sit back and watch them . it's hard to do what you described at a party where people are trying to have fun . maybe a calm little get together ... an infp at a party ? i've never been drunk but i think i'd probably just fall asleep if i was . - _ - i don't go to many parties but when i do , i tend to sit somewhere and talk to either 1 person the ... lol yeah . i'm just so awkward with flirting . i'm like uh ... i like your shirt . i have no game . but i try to do those things . i've straight up asked a guy out on a date once and he said yes . i ... i haven't , really . lol . i've been flirted with from time to time . a guy said that my eyes were pretty . but other than that , i have like no confidence , even though i've been told i'm cute . i just ... yeah i do that , too . i tend to be better with one on one . i don't like going places with my friends in groups . i end up feeling awkward and kind of in the background . lol . sounds like something i would do . it's actually something i have done . i suppose in related news , i had a small conversation that was longer than the ones i've had before with this guy i like ... oh and if you're interested , here's some youtube channels that talk about atheism . youtube - theramintrees's channel youtube - thethinkingatheist's channel youtube - qualiasoup's channel ... i think that if you're already at this point , after a little more thinking you'll eventually let go of that . yeah . i used to be really fearful of god and going to hell but as i've gotten older , i've become more atheistic . lol same . and yes , it doesn't work in college . my schedule of classes now lets me procrastinate but my first year was a huge wakeup call . i know what you mean by glass window . i was the same ... it's part of it , but i know that not all religious people are the same . the bad ones just make the news . but it's not the only reason . but i try not to discuss it because i'd rather leave it at i ... nope . i'm not religious . i used to go to church classes once a week when i was younger but i'm not much of a believer . kind of loner-ish , even though i had friends . they were mostly nerds , goths , punks , anime lovers , theater club kids and generally odd people . we hung out in the library and talked about how school ... i definitely live inside of my own head . i think everyone's already said it all . hmmm . well lately i've been really into shinee so i'd have to say them . particularly jonghyun ( and minho ) . river phoenix . i'm not ... i definitely know what you mean . it took a while . i'm more bitter at that person rather than the entire human race , though . i'm depressed about the human race for other reasons . lol . i suppose i see what you mean . i think about getting revenge sometimes . obviously i would never do it . and i can understand the feeling alive stuff . i tend to see movie ideas . like i'll come up with a plot and how it would look and feel . i don't know why i didn't get into film making . i can stand up for other people but it's hard standing up for me . sometimes i can , though . there was a time where i was in a relationship ... ish thing and it was kind of emotionally abusive and i ... i've had moments like that . sometimes i get into this outside looking in mode and it's either depressing or like what you described . yeah sometimes i think i'm invisible to other people . i'm just not a talker and i like spending time alone and people don't get to know me unless i've known them a while or they can bring it out . i think we tend to be in places where you would have a hard time finding us . i can't even remember if i replied to this . lol . but yeah . i'd say so . indeed . lol . one of the more recent weird ones i can remember was one where i was walking up to a house that looked like courage the cowardly dog's house in the middle of nowhere . the people there ... well i think that when you try hard to be anti-whatever is popular , you just end up losing your individuality / denying who you are . if it becomes popular , just consider yourself a trendsetter . lol ... just be yourself . if you like flannel , wear it . i suppose . but i don't put those down under the past employers section . ugh . i need a job . i've applied to a few places but it's frustrating when my parents bug me about it . it's not easy getting one nowadays . especially if your only working experiences are volunteer ... i feel like tommy is more extroverted . lol sounds like me . and my major is liberal arts . i can't quite pick one thing i want to do , but i think i might end up doing art therapy . i would be kind of insulted if someone called me a hipster , tbh . i suppose i'm kind of a hippie , though . my friend's boyfriend said i wasn't a hippie because he doesn't think i'm very go with the ... lol why ? is it too feminine ? : tongue : i probably come off as boring since i don't talk much . i suppose my bedroom . i already know what i want my future apartment / house to look like , too . ideally , it would have some hideout spaces . do you think that maybe you're bipolar ? but maybe it's not severe enough . although this can happen to me , too . it kinda sucks . i have really high periods and really low periods . i don't think it ... i have a scorpio rising but i do have an aquarius moon . lol i get this . i think it's just because i'm like 4 ' 9 . i'd say fall . ugh . i hate talking on the phone . and i don't like when people facebook message me . and i usually keep myself offline , too . i don't hate any of my friends , obviously . i just don't like to chat . i ...
