' this has directly nothing to do with them being intj's . they're probably just insecure . the part that i bolded sounds just like how the guy in the video described se . not every se dominant is bubbly but some can come off that way because of the energy . the cognitive functions explain ... i think the right term would be restlessness as opposed to energy when it comes to lack of exercise . it has happened to me before and all i really had to do was to get up and walk around a little ... it is perfectly possible to feel it when you're alone as well . you don't extrovert through people only . it doesn't require a conscious effort to get that energy either since sensory experiences are ... it doesn't matter if you sound like a nf . it's nothing to be afraid of . anyways , this video made me genuinely smile : i think the energy you're talking about is se . if it's there very often and it actually is extraverted sensing , then chances are you've mistyped yourself . an intj's natural state is pretty stable as ... dominate it and then if i'd get bored , i'd destroy it . is that the best comeback you can think of ? ? ? you're clearly not an intj . how dare you try to outsmart intj's ? ? ! ! we're all geniuses with superbrains . everyone knows that . go back to your trolling , since that's all you're good at . i pick my nose in secrecy when no one's around . exposing your weaknesses is not very smart and i'd recommend you to do the same and not flash your stupidity in front of others . how do you know that no one can see through your facade ? do you even realize that there might be someone seeing through your facade from miles away , because it's just so obvious to some ? you are way ... i saw all of them swirling around me with a bright neon green color . everyone is different , despite their personality type . however , there is a pattern that i've noticed which is that most people that i usually don't get along well with are either fi / fe dom / aux . i'd ... so , each enneagram type has their own fears , desires and holy ideas etc . but , what if one could strongly relate to a type's fears and desires but nothing else . for example : let's say a ... none of the things that you wrote seem unbelievable to me . i was just thinking it would be very draining for your brain , physically , to constantly , consciously analyze things and do the things that ... i mean analyzing things consciously all the time . are you usually consciously aware of it ? i have two questions about ti that i hope you could help me clarify : 1 ) i've heard many times that ti doms ( especially intp's ) consciously analyze things in their heads all the time . this , to me , ... i have some theories that i'd probably never change despite evidence stating otherwise . that may be because i never come to a final conclusion as i don't think you actually can or you don't know if ... so i quickly thought about this . i'm having a hard time thinking how i could have written in my own words what fe and fi is without considering any external sources . i don't either see why i'd ... haha , really ? well i did have a hard time determining if i have te or ti which was very hard so i looked at fe and fi instead and found that i basically never encounter fi and when fe starts showing ... alright from all the information i've gathered it would go something like this : fi is feeling pointed inwards - subjective , to oneself . since fi is introverted it doesn't , usually , show itself ... arkigos after doing more research i can confidently say that i'm not an fi dom . i don't even have fi included in my 4 functions , i'm sure . everyone is a feeler and everyone is a thinker and just ... i got all the information i needed . i'll let this thread die now .. so what you're saying is that in socionics i might resemble an isfp but not as much when it comes to mbti ? or would you say that i'm probably both an isfp and an esi ? anyways , thanks for you ... alright . could a bad visual memory be a part of low se ? i already see that there's no definite answer to that question .. what got me thinking of it was this isfp guy that i saw on youtube ... i don't think i've confused my imagination with reality but i tend to be a bit clumsy sometimes because i don't take notice of my environment . that doesn't have to indicate low se though . well , ... i could relate to about 40 % of it . especially some parts were spot on like not trusting my own judgements and being afraid of being incompetent . the first one that i mentioned is also a typical 6 ... i don't really have anything to say about fi ( i can only talk about te ) mainly because all the descriptions i've read about it are very different and then which one should i go by ? some of ... never once have i said in this thread that i am an intp . i realized that i wasn't and therefore i made this thread . and i didn't say that theorizing = ne or that imagination = ni . the thing i want ... it might exist , who knows ? but then you could make such excuses for everything : i'm not depressed , i'm just in an ni / fi loop .. doesn't sound too reliable . i must've made more than 5 type me ... nope , i don't have adhd or anything related to that . only synapses that don't connect very well currently haha . if you know what that means then you'll get 100 boxes of cookies but not from me ... my inferior function is probably not te , and then that would leave me with the possibility of me being an esfp . i don't know what to say about that since i don't know myself enough to make any ... yeah , i didn't feel the urge to answer them .. this girl was telling me that i never stand up for myself over and over again . i just calmly said you're wrong . i do stand up for myself . that's ... i'm pretty sure i have the functions te / fi or fi / te and not ti / fe or fe / ti . however , could you see me as an ni dominant ? and if so , why ? if you want my cookies you have to give me your ... i predicted you'd say that ... se sometimes when i'm upset i tend to crave some kind of sensory pleasure like eating , partying or breaking things etc . there was a time in my life when i was ... i don't know if i'm more introverted or extroverted . perhaps i'm more introverted as i pay more attention to myself than others . there isn't always a desire for me to be the leader of things even ... could you see me as an entj or is intj a stronger possibility ? i can see myself having more ni then . they would be so intelligent that they could take over the world , although if they were , would they even bother taking over the world ? would it matter to them ... i find my connections very hard to explain so i don't even bother explaining them ( and i don't feel the need to talk about them anyway ) . do you still need more information about me to be able to ... i thought it was about what order your functions are in . but i understand what you mean . i didn't put a lot of empashis on observing and i don't know about the other two . there is one thing i've ... answer to this : alright , the first thing i did was obviously observing , then i tried to understand everything and also see how it relates to me . and then i started questioning whether you're ... when i say that happiness is very important for me it doesn't necessarily indicate fi . i know for a fact that if i'm not happy it will be very hard for me to get things done and acheive the things i ... yes , that's exactly how it is for me . i feel really bad if i've expressed strong emotions around other people . and i'm very sensitive , but that's something i believe that i've inherited ( type is ... i don't relate to fi so much that i'd see it as my dominant function and te is most likely not my inferior function . i want things to make sense logically and can easily spot logical inconsistencies ... maybe , i'll have to look more into that but i kind of doubt that i'm an ni dom tbh .. i'm curious , why do you think i'm an f ? not saying i'm not , just wondering . all this time , i've only gone by the functions and not stereotypes . you might be right about me being a j , but still isfj ... i don't know . details drain me and i barely even take notice of them , i ... i know , i was just trying to see if i might be an fi-se user . isn't se about wanting new experiences also ? i , for example , don't like travelling at all because i just can't bring myself to see ... is that the only reason you think i might be an intj ? looking at the cognitive functions can you still picture me as one ? i realized that being honest and putting my emotions out there would provide the best results . and this is the internet , no one know who i am so it's fine . inferior te is not something i can ...
