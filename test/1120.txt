' h . p lovecraft and edgar allen poe . which makes sense , since my main influence is stephen king . class reunion by rona jaffe . bought the book at crown books ( a super cheap used book store ) and it's surprisingly good :D carrie ( the film version ) megaman x cloud ( starts as an ixtp , ends up a infp ) squall ( same thing , maybe ends up an isfp ) alucard ? ? ? ( castlevania ) what is it for ? can't you ever care about what others think ? in mn , which is why i haven't responded much on the forum ( although i will pop in from time to time ) . wishing i could hang out with a perc member irl after reading these posts . at first i thought it was going to be another one of those flame posts but you did a really good post there . it's true , i shouldn't worry too much of being rejected or turned down . especially since a ... god fucking damnit , are we really going to do this thread again ! ? most infjs i know can come off much more logic than feeling at times . especially when they're grumpy . ^ yes ! ! ! love that comic : laughing : ^ peepshow ( british show ) , although i doubt anyone has seen it . ^ i don't know who the hell the person with the green hair is supposed to be . and wow , tifa really let herself go . ^ ace bottom ... australian ... so are you ... except a little more goth . you're more of the marriageable type . you won't find many women who want you now , but wait until they hit thirty . then they'll like you . so basically they're saying women will fuck all the ... what about rainman ? you just made my day : laughing : lol . the trick is , squirt him with a small squirt gun and shout no ! everytime that happens . soon he'll learn and drop the act . you can change that mood of yours now : wink : be curious to hear how it was just wait a little longer . over messaging him can come off as desperate . good luck , i'd be curious to see as to what happens . i'm sure it'll go well , he's lucky enough to have been kissed by someone like you . married with children futurama modern family miami vice friends etc . , etc . mostly older shows . i don't mind cop shows but i don't like the new forensics and cop shows . absopositively best one yet : laughing : but you didn't say completely : tongue : and i can be your gynecologist ( probably came off creepy ) what book ? that doesn't mean that you can't be christian and have a eastern philosophy . plenty of christians do . i suppose the old testament and paul's philosophy is much western but christ's is very eastern ... just have a dress and staple a bunch of plush cats to it . and when people ask who you're supposed to be just say pussy galore well , maybe except for the no and not parts guitar and piano nah , you can easily have a leg up on people when it comes to financial i . q . that doesn't have much to do with type at all . read some books such as rich dad poor dad and you'll be smarter money wise . who wouldn't want to be under the limelight ? i'd be nostalgic for you ( if that makes sense ) you never know ... duh ! duh ! duuuhhh ! honestly i wouldn't mind giving my name but i have the fear of someone irl finding my user name and seeing all those oh-so-wonderful discussions we all ... how about them cupcakes . yes . hey , is black lagoon any good ? should've looked at my profile photo . and yes . sure ... of course they don't . not with the meat eating is morally wrong shouts and i'm a meat eater ragh ! option on the voting as well as i eat white meat so i'm a hypocrite . or above all , vegetarians ... why yes my little raver . not the strap on ! not the strap on ! ! ! this only applies to infp males . well ... most of them anyways . sounds more like a confederacy ( nothing good or bad about it ) rather than a libertarian view . to be fair , the government system doesn't really help the politicians . because they have to be careful of what they say and do . they could say screw you i'm doing what the hell i want but then ... yeah , well history is about to change : cool : ^ who's that in your avatar lightning ? ^ and waiting to go to work . no , it's scientific that human beings are omnivores . we have both sharp ( carnivores ) and flat ( herbivores ) teeth , a sign of being omnivore . also , many of our primate cousins eat both meat and plants . probably because of the confidence . and the jacket leaves enough for the imagination but enough for the eyes as well : wink : lol you probably late posted : crazy : and no , although your avatar is so ... alurring .
