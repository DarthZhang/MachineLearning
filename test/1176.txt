what do you mean ? to be honest . i have experienced way too many times people exiting my life . and i hate it . what used to get me up in the morning was forming a close bond with somebody . but people just seem to ... i've been having a bit of a rough time lately motivating myself . so i thought this might be a nice discussion point , and it might help me gain some perspective . so , infps , what makes you want ... i didn't realise until kind of recently . but a lot of other people . well i guess , most people , don't look at friendship in the same way us infps do . we are loyal , trustworthy and assume people ... there cannot be an infp alive that doesn't like regina spektor . infps can be like cornered animals when something sets them off . nothing apparently . i used to cry every 6 or so months when my bottled up emotions got too much . but i haven't done in years now .  i really don't like the way the world works . i don't like how i'm supposed to act as a man . i'm finding it harder and harder to enjoy people's company . i kind of wish i could just take some ... id say a lot of us are walking contradictions . we want to be close to people but are often shy . thats the simplist way i can describe us i think eeek . someone just thanked an old post of mine where i am wearing a black shirt with rolled up sleeves . baggy pale jeans and white converse . i just like to post this to try and redeem myself . ... a picture xtoxicx / azura nova took of me when i visited her a little ? it's like thinking paris is in canada : tongue : anyways since this is the pictures thread my friend thinks that he is dating an intj do intj's like to please people and have trouble saying no ? because he seems to think she has trouble saying no even when she is not happy . love the chorus . and the video for that matter . tripppyyy do exactly as an infp woman expects you to or she will be very upset . i mean i'm an idealist ... but jeez . it's like she expects me to be absolutely perfect or she has a strop . it's really ... of course . be the person you want to be . but don't let it take over your life . the people you meet and the things you do shape what kind of person you will become . you're always changing and ... don't get me wrong . i'm happy you've found happiness . but . don't base it all on one thing . be a good person because you want to be . not because you feel you have to be . it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong . what matters is that you enjoy life . and make it enjoyable for others . just another day i am no longer afraid of moths . not really sure . 21 and still feel like a kid though . just like kind of general advice for long distance relationships / infpxinfp relationships . not that my opinion is good advice or fact though x-d i should really start posting here again . hearing from people who feel the same as i do is somewhat comforting . anyways . i was just wondering , i'm in a relationship with someone i met on these ... i hate being a guy and all of the stereotypes that come with it . please don't any of you douchey guys thank this it'll be the most ironic thing ever . i hate how my brain reacts to people . i hate how i look , how i act , who i am . i am a nerdy loner with no friends , no career and no life . i'm simply a burden to everyone i meet and they probably ... this doesn't really have anything to do with my current mood , but listening to the chorus quite loud seems to make me feel better .  i'm glad i'm home alone tonight . i feel like if someone said one more negative thing about me i'd probably punch something . my girlfriend stalks me on here . did i mention she's really cool and nice ?

that's awful =/ that causes health problems . basically described me , apart from my communication could use a bit more work =P but yeah i agree . probably about 2 guys i know i'd recommend to people . i just felt the need to make this thread . because it was recently brought to my attention that a lot of infp guys are in fact . not nice guys . now this is not directed at anyone in particular on ... i need to sort what i want to do for a living , but i really don't know . i think a carer or a teacher of some sort . stare at them . a lot =P this thread confuses me people in france have it easy man . they're protesting about the retirement age being risen to 62 x-d it's like one of the lowest in europe already ! i like how you just started raving about it since that guy won lol classic i'm so going to hell oooh we can ?
