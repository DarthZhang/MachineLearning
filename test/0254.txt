' i've heard that before and disagree that it doesn't apply . i've known lots of people who have personality disorders and they are all different and as easy to type as anyone else when you know them ... what else could you possibly want ? serious question . i don't think the root of this question is type . it looks like a much broader , he's just not that into you kind of question , based on being extremely short but still finding words to make excuses ... it frankly depends on how exhausting the other person is . some people wear me down more than others . my intp ex was so chill that i could think and read while he was in the same room . i still needed ... what's the problem ? what did he do ? there must be something going on for you to be looking for relationship tips , so spill . did he actually say the relationship wasn't enjoyable ? sounds like he's ... the one i know touches the paint , and then after he has been fully satisfied with his paint-touching comes clean about touching it all sorry not sorry . but when he's done it i thought it was dumb ... he's an entj . they have ways . her behavior doesn't make any rational sense given the current information unless we assume she knows that something about the twitter account is inappropriate . most ... my emotionally unstable parent and strict perfectionist parent were the same one , mom . dad was stable in comparison , which was what he was getting out of it . her sainted husband . what a guy ! i ... you compared it to an addiction . how do you think it is different from an addiction ? yes , because there is nothing offensive about name dropping a person in a thread about stupid people . he was in no way just trying to get a reaction . this is a legitimate discussion . making things ... emotionally unavailable , ambivalent , waste of time . drop it like it's hot . when you cut contact he will ramp up the texting . if you go all in he will head for the hills . he only wants what he ... well , i don't think you have to feel it as strongly as they do , or strongly at all , but you do have to feel something for it to count as empathy and not just a guess . it might be a very good , ... that there is no point in arguing with someone who is just trolling you . i don't understand how your example is supposed to prove your point . yes , that is sympathy . and ? if you can put yourself in someone's shoes , not feel what they are feeling , and still believe you ... yeah ! that's it . so they may not be mistyped like i always assumed . i didn't think they were that stupid either though ... i mean , i thought they were about as smart as i am ...  ... i don't like ... maybe they try to predict outcomes , but are generally wrong . maybe they are very good in one area , but lack the ability to generalize . maybe when they are choosing from the possibilities , they have ... this is the definition of sympathy . it's only empathy if you feel their feelings , or at least what you assume is their feelings . none of this is romantic for me . it's all friends stuff . doesn't mean he doesn't like you romantically , but .. it's all stuff i do ( or would do ) for friends i like as people but am not interested in ... i just came from the angry music thread . i had a few dreams when i was in therapy that my therapist explained to me . they were , i regret to inform you , quite literal and dull . in one , i was supposed to go somewhere with my family , but ... none of them . every personality type consists mostly of liars and jerks , with a few good ones mixed in to confuse you . so for a song to truly be angry it must also be incoherent ? my accomplishments are pretty impressive , at least that's what i get out of people's reactions when they ask me what i've done with my life . but they are not financially impressive . i don't have a ... there is a huge tv in my room and i love it . #againsttheflow stooop with the fi / fe misunderstandings . fi can soak up other people's bad feelings just as much as fe , the difference is that fe ... the charming down-home wholesomeness of norwegians is the central focus of lilyhammer . you guys are so goshdarn cute . i love how you went from uh huh yawn well it's probably not considered ... uh oh . it's not normal , run for your life . he loves you for sure , but love is not enough . sometimes people need to be alone to work through themselves ; this is one of those times . you are ... you cannot be vulnerable with a dog . a dog is a living being but has very limited language comprehension and is also property , there has to be some risk for it to count as vulnerability . you can be ... it doesn't alter the proportion , i don't think , only the experience . it's a quality issue , not quantity . interacting with people in a more vulnerable way feels so much more worthwhile to me . it makes ... no , i disagree that she doesn't understand . i haven't personally checked up on her research methods , so i'm operating on the assumption that they are sound , but under that assumption casual ... i love this so much . real talk . the less realistic the better when it comes to fantasy though , so i can see why this movie would be huge . ahaha i feel the exact same way about the infj forum . all humans have feelings . i think that among mbti enthusiasts there is a tendency to ascribe standard psychological dysfunction to the type of ... i'd also go with estp . typing him is complicated by his narcissism , but even crazy estj maintain better control than he does . same as most here , i wear the mask sometimes and sometimes i don't . definite preference for unmasked , and i don't think i'm very reliant on it . but i'm also not the type to rebel for the sake of ... this is entirely untrue for me . feelings are logical , and without them nothing would work . sometimes i wonder when people who are trying to develop ais are going to figure out that they are not able ... i meant more classic fucked up entp than classic torrid love story . the one i recently dated routinely projected his feelings onto me . it was really strange . he'd say things like , i did that because ... damn , is this a creepy case of projection or what . i am thinking about this person a lot . clearly , that means they are thinking about me so much that their thoughts are ending up inside my head ! ... aw man why did i watch that . : lemmings_by_mirz 123 you're really starting to fall for me . omg fucking classic oh no , they always come back . they just don't stay . ha , i'd like to know that too . he sounds classic avoidant though . kind of amazing that she got him to agree to try a relationship at all . grandmaster level nf . i used to be more timid in expressing feelings like that , and it was not coming from a place of deep exceptional love . love certainly , but the weak expression was because it was smothered in ... i also neglect / forget food when stressed . i only overeat if it's convenient or practical , like at a buffet . i fucking gorge myself . i haven't been to an all you can eat buffet for years though . i ... this is what happened to me , yes . if one is trying to justify weak sauce displays of affection / vulnerability , they may be looking for a different path than the one they are on . i'm just ... it sounds like excuses for someone's lack of emotional availability . i've done the same , came close to doing it again today . well , actually , considering his stunted development , this here could be ... do this asap . i wish i'd done it sooner . they were still able to help but i could have spared myself a lot of grief . find a part time job , keep going to school . this might sound like it would add ... you'll never know until you try . my personal experience supports this . at the start of this year i surrendered to vulnerability by admitting that i desperately needed help , with everything , and ... that bit at the top about anger is pretty accurate . like some sort of blizzard-avalanche , but quiet . and also the wish-fulfillment bit at the end about it hurting the other person more . if only ! not wanting it is a reason not to deserve it , like anything else you could give to someone . why continue to give to someone who is ungrateful ? untrue , at least for intj . it took a month to get over the last guy ( dated for two months ) , and only because that is how long it took for my feelings to catch up with my brain . i was really in love ... oh man , i forgot about j . k . rowling . she kind of gets a pass because it is a children's series , but not really . if i understood it , i'd replicate it and make a fortune of my own . there is a high number of people who enjoy reading but are not actually very smart . it's surprising when you realize it because of the heavy association between reading and intelligence , but people ... replace food with alcohol avoid all contact with other people so i can listen obsessively to the same songs ( s ) on repeat , or daydream , often i'll go on very long ( like 3 hour long ) walks while ...
