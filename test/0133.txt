same story here i'm feeling it a bit right now , i have a habit of going out on long 40 + mile bike rides for no reason , i did one yesterday and felt fine until i got home and could barely get up the front steps ... i grew up pretty isolated from people , and reading books was the only thing i could do , i got to really like reading fiction books , i always read the entire book , but i also read really really fast i love to wear t shirts from threadless.com , and cargo shorts with pockets big enough to carry my flip flops in , i hate wearing shoes and i only put them on when i go into places where being barefoot ... awww _t i want pillows ... thank you for the hugs though i've been forced to introvert through a lot of my life , i grew up in the country side with no other kids around and i'm an only child ... now when i need my own time my favorite is going on a long ... i usually just get that feeling around s's in general ... haha , why thank you 1 aww but this is just hypothetical 2 whoops ... sorry , i didn't even realize ... my internet is really slow , i must have hit the button twice in my impatience for it to load i only have the one ... and she says she does want to shes just never horny ... then if i try to get her horny she gets annoyed ... * sigh * i only have the one ... why thank you , more than anything else , i think i do stuff like that just cause i'm really comfortable with myself , it makes life much more fun , the pink fairy outfit won me 1st at a rocky horror ... nope :P i'm just your everyday fabulous straight guy i'm a straight guy , i generally prefer female avatars though , because in relating to people if they can't see me they generally assume i'm a girl , and i like confusing people , and it's a pink fairy ... as in s & m , i'm more of a masochist than a sadist yeah , that's why spanking is really hit or miss ... it's not my favorite , nibbles is fun , but a nice hard bite on the neck right as things are about to climax just takes it to a whole nother level ^ _ ^ ... thats me thats me ! i love biting and being bit , the sex just isn't complete without it , spanking is fun as long as both people are into it oh i would love to , shall i use the vibrating jewelry ? = ^ _ ^ = mrrroww ? i love my kitty ! and awww too bad , piercing are fun i havent got any tattoos yet ... i know what i want but i haven't found an artist who could draw it how i like it as in going 1 or 2 ... * shudders * thats just gross . why yes i do , i have my left cartilidge and rook pierced , and my right trecus , i used to have my right eyebrow pierced , and plan to again ... and ... everything that doesnt involve blades , # 1 , or # 2 ... i'm a very accommodating man you see , although i must say i have a bit of a fetish for piercings hehe personally i find being submissive to be relaxing ... it takes away the worrying if you're doing the right thing for the other person or not and yes , of course , i think we've covered that it's the class fo the f and the t that can make it so hard to get through sometimes , most of our actions will be driven by our feelings prompting us to do silly frivolus random things that won't make ... everywhere at the same time because putting someone into a category limits them to that category , and people are so vastly complex and interesting that one category can never truly fit a person so it's like you're trying to ... aww it sounds like somebody needs a hug * reaches out to shadowplay * ah to live that wonderful dream ... what would you like me to do first mistress ? ah now that sounds like the life ... ^ _ ^ i am your humble servant mistress * kneels obediently * i'll wear your blindfold any day ^ _ ^ thas me ! gemini + enfp = crazy fun times ^ _ ^ lets leave these boys to play with each other gryffindor ! oh my , this is turning into quite a sausage fest ... hemo ? rose ? panda ? where did you go ? * hides * hmmm perhaps , it's been known to happen when i've got a few drinks in me , i just have high standards for guys :P now that looks like fun ^ _ ^ ah but there's a story behind it take a look ^ _ ^ oh i'll love you up and down and all around hemo ! * pounces * never ... ever ? o_o no please , teh panda suit is only for scarin the kiddies i actually have a big panda suit ... it's creepy as hell hey now , theres enough to go around not if you yell surprise first ! always wanted to see how it is with one of our own and oooh a collar , fun ! and what a cute flower i see , oh things we could do ^ _ ^ oh youd be surprised how many people will fit on one bed .. hehe and of course the couches are good too party time ! well you two seem to have your own thing going , but i'd be more than happy to join in * wicked grin * i'm sorry to hear that
