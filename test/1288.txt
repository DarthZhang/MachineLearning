have taken the test on differentsites on different occasions and had different results . always an nf , though . ... yeah , i'm confused too as to why this would tell me i am an i instead of an e . he's entp , and maybe this is one of those times he just wants to debate something ... haven't heard back from him yet ... someone close to me suggested that maybe i am more of an infp than enfp . they gave me this list of questions and now i am interested to see if anyone on this forum has an opinion . which way do you ... yes , and instant thought brought on by subconciously going through so many possible scenerios within a second or two and the most likely outcome pops out on top of the list in my head . and yes , ... so yes , this did indeed happen . this reading people ... i cannot explain it . it isn't anything that i conciously try to do-things just pop into my head about people that others don't seem to pick up ... you poor thing ! i always pass out when my blood is drawn if i watch . when i don't watch , i'm fine . yes , all the time . just 30 minutes ago my dh's friend called and said ' bring a couple of beers over and we'll sit on the dock ' . they fish all the time there , but today i told my dh he is going to ... so sorry to make you sad . there are a great many things he does bring to the table , and i do love him for all the positives . yes , the above seems very sad if that was all i had , but it's not . it's ... enfp 175 ... when my istj dh tells me it's okay , he accepts me as i am . wtf ?
