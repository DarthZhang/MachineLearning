being unable to share how you feel with people easily . ... 8 physical touch 7 quality time 6 acts of service 5 words of affirmation 4 receiving gifts i think i used to believe that words of affirmation was second , but it makes sense quality time is ... are you saying you don't have a personality ? it's ok , it's a common problem in this day and age ... ;) home by she and him i'm super confused and at my wits ends . i believed i was a entj , but i'm really not sure anymore . the first time i took the the test i got intj , then my friend was convinced i was an e which i ... mom : isfj dad : estp sister : isfp ( though now and then i think she is an n ) sister : estj sister : istj me : entj for the most part these are speculations , most of my family can't stand the mbti ... yeah ... all i heard was that the f-bomb was used over 500 times in like 3 hours . that basically means people were swearing every minute , you literally couldn't show a clip of it to your dying grandma ... finally someone else ! i always had to keep my love for him to myself , because everyone made him out to be the character you were supposed to hate . on a side note , i didn't technically love him , ... this is a sad one but ; sheldon cooper . i absolutely love him . there is another one ( a better one ) but i seriously can't remember it . i just know all my girl friends hated this fictional girl , ... am i not humble , enough ? no , never . sorry , we never are . totally get that ! i actually do the same thing . i guess i have a problem when someone gets distracted by sometime visual , but getting mentally distracted is fine . :P yup i've got some messed up ... i have difficulties finishing things , unless it's for someone else .. then i try a bit harder . people can be a really good motivator . what i can't stand nor do i understand is when i'm talking to ... world map , solar system , periodic table , this tin copper colored sun that holds a candle , dried flowers ( that i picked myself ( forever alone ) ) , a mirror ... i think that's it . i really try not to ... but yes i think i do at times . though sometimes finding out someone's type just confirms what i believe to be true .. does that make sense ?
