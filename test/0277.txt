' i'm libra . i used to read a lot on horoscopes until i found mbti . you might already know this , but just in case you need a tip for handling fi : remember the universal laws of feelings that you've taught yourself ? forget about them . they don't work with fi ... this shit tickles the infp in me . for the internally cluttered ( like me ) , writing a diary does help you clear out your thoughts and give you a perspective , but after a while when you look back and read what you've written , it all ... on top of long threads i even have a problem with reading , in general . it includes me reading an entire paragraph while not taking in a single word . it's like i get lost in the midst of reading . what ... where the fk r u death ? ? ( i guess that's just mumbling to myself really ) why so few infp canadians ? common ! ! ! haha yea ur friend sounds like a bit more friendlier version of the infp . but i'm totally similar to you , just standing back and looking nowhere . my intj friend has more acquaintances than me . i ... the best thing will be to ask a close friend / relative who are the decisive types . lay out all the possibilities that you have thought of and all the factors that will be involved in making a decision ... exactly . infps that do like to fake it don't feel any better . but i can tell you from experience , that once an infp does find a true friend , he / she will throw away their mask and leave all the fake ... i don't think your quite accurate with the infp generalization . i rather stay alone for long periods of time rather than go out and interact ( with the shallow world ) just for the sake of it . i ... as you just mentioned about classifying your true emotions vs projections . that is exactly what i do . i just give my feelings higher priority . you still feel the projected feelings just as intensely , ... so you're telling me that infj's don't usually have this sort of problem ? taking myself for instance , i have no issues with my looks nor the idea of getting rejected but it feels like i run into ... depends on my mood . either i'm a total jerk and tell them to piss off or i end up flaking ( if i'm not able to say no ) . i'd like to be a jerk all the time , but some days u just can't no . hence , ... i would not go out of my way to please her , because that doesn't lead to anywhere good . but the small time that you get to talk to her , make it count . in the sense that whenever you do get an ... it's really disappointing when people don't match up to ur expectations , but then again different people have different ways of corresponding or showing any kind of attachment or affection . make sure ... we might be confused as fk , but we r pretty intuitive as well . yes ur right , there a lot of infps confused whether they are truly infp / intp / infj / enfp , but when it comes to being an s type or an n ... if you were an infp , you would've known . let it all out . it really helps . u've hit a soft spot . i need to contemplate this newly found secret of mine . for some unknown reason , it tickles me . awesome job touk ! ! this thread just gave me some sort of a virtual license to stalk all you people as much as i want for as long as i want . turn around . please turn around and look . rather than making reality seem like a drag , i see my imaginations as a treat , a pleasure , like chocolate . in response to original thread , even in my idealizations i'm not the initiator . i don't think they are friends really . that happens with me too , but with acquiantances / friends , not the truly close ones . seems like you were looking at them as potential date interests rather than friends . that explains why you seem to cling on their bad qualities rather than the rest of them . i'm usually misplacing and loosing things left and right . but when i loose a possession especially given to me by someone , i totally snap . my ability to personify such items doesn't really help at ... similar stuff has happened to me for the sake of rules . i feel sorry for such people . these folks won't even take a dump if the stars weren't alligned the right way . time paradox and the destruction of universe . i thought you were refering to the movie donnie darko . apparantely not . it's time to be the scary bunny rabbit , screw feelings . this is a good question . being an infp i can feel anything , literally . the smallest of things can cause the most unsettling of emotional stirs in my head . however , when a major incident happens , like ... infp forum is the last place you want to ask around for improving work ethic . you would get a lot of consolation and encouragement , but that's about it . intps and infps are rite up there . lazy as fuck . just watched a whole movie today at work on my laptop . sitting at an angle such that anyone passing doesn't notice it . not really . my feelings are severely detached from this world and i could seriously care less about whose killing whom . i feel my feelings are really self centered . oh thank god . i thought that it was just me . i know exactly what you're talking about . everything is going well and perfect and suddenly there's this one small tiny that just sets you off . it's ... no kidding . i'm a addicted to the runner's high bigtime . around 30-40 km a week , on a busy week . don't feel at ease at all when i haven't run , makes me feel like a junkie . my friend from past recalls a ghost encounter we had had 5-6 years ago , and i was a part of it . but i can't seem to recall it , and usually i'm known for my good memory . it's really strange , to this ... great concept . good script for most parts . however , i think they made it way to commercial for my liking . it kind of turned me off . they had the potential to do so much more with that idea . yes , you are quiet right , its just not the bus but rather everywhere . i certainly do observe but its hard to deduce any conclusions , how some people in a crowded bus just sit at the first seat they ... when a bus is totally empty and people enter for the first time , they always choose to sit alone until all seats in a single grouping are occupied by at least one person and then people start sitting ... no point giving my 8 yr old version any useful encouraging advice because i would just forget about it the next day . if there was one thing i would do is to introduce me to music at that age ... surely regulus black . got into the dark side because of his family history and his own fascination with it , without fully contemplating the consequences and the dynamics at work . after he realized ... i tell them , yes . you are right . i'm terrible with a smirk on my face . people should try this , it just messes with their heads and they don't know what to say next . to the contrary , i kind of crave these special moments alone . i enjoy them more when i feel them alone . if someone's with you , then it's a safe bet that they are not on the same wavelength , and ... babies freak me out . maybe its all those cheesy horror movies i've watched . they get cute after about 3-4 yrs . well i'm certainly hoping things calm down a bit , in my head . i'm 21 now and its getting worse and worse . my introversion and intuitive scores just keep soaring and my brain just gets heavier by ... your assuming here that the 2 % intp population is on the rise . maybe 50 years ago there were around 8 % intps and now they are being weeded out by society . evolution working against you ? i was ... yea i do get these critical fits sometimes . the thing is that i don't trust my criticism because i know its really subjective of my feelings . in these circumstances i just make my tj friends ... the composer must be having a hysterical fit looking at the crowd that turned up . wtf ? u've got to be taking the piss here .
