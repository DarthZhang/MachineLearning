:) haha nope ! good point ! i always end up having a great time and meeting all sorts of new people . i hate going back on my word too ... i feel so flaky . my fiance has been working 7 days a week . i'm sure this has something to do with it , come to think of it . :) i love to travel as well . i don't mind being a hermit at all . but recently and for the first time that i can remember , i've actually become somewhat bored , with everything . odd . i've been getting worse and worse with this . i'll make plans with someone and be somewhat excited , but in a day or less i don't want to go or see the person . i don't even want to talk to them most ... 3896738970 it is exhausting trying to be approachable and polite . it's trying to be something that you aren't . accepting everything . i am so bad that i cannot work for anyone and have to run my own business . for some reason when i first start a job , i draw to myself men that are trying to bed me . then they see that this will ... i think i seem more collected than i am . i'm actually extremely hurt . what makes it worse is that he can't even have a conversation with me ... i think it's that istj silence thing . it ... i only get my nails done for work . i get a mani and a pedi . and i always do my lips . actually my guy sounds even worse than hers ! and he is a dumb ass too . : frustrating : i will never make this mistake again . i find this to be very true . i would hate to be on the receiving end of my wrath when someone messes with one of my people or me . i have heard it's very scary to witness ! me too ! if they are anything like me , we should get along ... right ? wow ! sounds like us . thanks for the post . lol me and my loose paper all over the place ! i can't keep a notebook , i have tons of them scattered and all disorganized . it's awful . i didn't used to be so bad . i do the same thing and i ... this is what i'm confused about . i'm not sure if he feels bad about putting me through all of this . i think that he doesn't or he wouldn't have been lying to me all along . the more i think of it , ... he has that passive aggressive silent treatment down ... for sure . i have to have most of my time alone . i don't want to talk for days or weeks at a time . i am very much a give it all kind of person . and yes , he does have that filter of not telling everything . and , he always says i'm a terrible liar , i cannot lie . but that was a big lie too .  ... i think i may have something like adhd . i start to do one project and another one calls my attention and then another one and i get into a brain jumble about what to do . it can be difficult to pin ... yikes ! not good news . my bf is an istj and i am an intj . he isn't forthcoming with his emotions and can't have a deep conversation without very long pauses ... recently i discovered that he is a compulsive liar .  ... i think what if i were in a different stage of my life ? and i am very uncomfortable with being liked for being attractive . i withdraw and never want to see the person that complimented me . ... being mad at myself for getting sick and missing a bunch of workouts . very counterproductive , but true . i'm wondering why i gave the lady on the phone so much info ... she just froze up and couldn't handle it anyway . i'm surrounded by incompetence . i'm laying in bed with a sore throat , wondering if the guy that got a nosebleed all over my v gave me hiv last night . : unsure : add to list : dysmorphia . also , i was anorexic as a teen , after i gave up alcohol and drugs . i was diagnosed with ptsd . i've seen many psychiatrists , and i'm not so sure that i believe any of them . i mean , you go in , tell them what's going on , and they diagnose you . for some people , these ... every time that i have overlooked my first intuition with anyone , i have regretted it . i try to trust , because i want to have someone in my life that i can trust . but then i just end up resentful ... exactly ! i thought that i was the only one . omg ! that is me ! i have also noticed in all of my past and present relationships that i behave emotionally like the man and in turn they behave more stereotypically female . i'm very critical and people tend to ... i didn't read this entire thread . i'm an intj and i sure am different than everyone . less girly in a sense , but even more feminine in another sense . people have always told me that they have never ... thanks cookie monster ! thanks everyone . i still have to figure out the gold tipping ! another intj saying hi ! hi everyone . i just wanted to stop here before posting anywhere else and say hello . interesting forum ! : happy : '
