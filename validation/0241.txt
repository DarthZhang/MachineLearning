looking forward to see what new path or experiences i'll discover for myself . as always :  thanks for writing my own answer for me . i can't say . do people ever accuse you of being selfish / arrogant / egocentric for doing so ? luna is best girl in hp , so you should be proud . thinking introversion no mentions of untergang ? it was pretty good imo . rather amusing , since i can definitely see where you're coming from . i've had a bit of an experience with an infj girl in the past . while it is somewhat exciting , it does feel like you're going in ... and they don't get any better than that . but seriously , that quote really warms my heart . you'd be surprised . forlorn face on point with this one : who would think that existence is so wonderful yet so terrible . ironic , since esfj females find my personality tedious , boring and overcomplicated to the extreme , and that includes my own mother . as far as my experiences go anyway . i wonder what the properties are of the white powder that the hairdresser brushes over your neck after a haircut ... seems like an istp or intj man would suit you well . heck , even a level-headed infj with emotional control . i've pondered over this before , but i am rather young so i can't really make a convincing ... nice job sticking for us , lass . also , i'm pretty sure that infjs stick well away from extremes and i find the angel and demon analogies rather unwarranted . i tend to find that we are either fallen ... oh , i'm ( mostly ) perfect for you , since i live in the uk and from mainland europe . i'm also type 4 . if only we were both of a different sexual orientation . unfortunate for you . but as they say , ... i've been through the period myself , stage fright and all , and i can't say that i'm fully immune . you just have to steel yourself eventually and carry on . after all , everything will come to pass . couldn't be bothered . eh , just do it yourself and save money . stellar opportunity spotted : oooh , i've got a got good one ! why do ghosts take the elevator ? - to lift their spirits . enfj huh ? why am i not surprised ? but seriously , how often do you even see infj / enfj relationships . when your mind's thoughts contradict themselves all the time . yoroshiku onegaishimasu ! just ignore me casually glancing by . i'm starting to think that we tend to over analyse things too much . simple , practical and above all comfortable . seems like the imaginative type ? isfx ? tell him that you're his christmas present . aizar , nabbit ladies , i believe that you misunderstood me . i merely stated an amusing observation , not a complaint from my part . think of it as a poor joke from someone who hasn't been online in ... if you would have the time - lone adventurer thanks ! yes ? life what can i say ? not much , since i'm too bored to type . any mbti type type is compatible with any other so long as you work to bridge the gap in differences . the question as to how large the ... i've been gone for months and i see that you guys whine as much as ever . i do indeed . thoughts of poirot and penguin classics swing to mind ... this gets me all fired up : tbh , while i agree that male infjs can be more sensitive than most , i hate it when they are complete pushovers . and tears ? cmon . as a male infj speaking here , he'll get over it . from what i've gathered , and with that 7w6 type , i would say so . i have a tendency to step on things , most annoying my glasses . so , infjs are gryffindor now ? interesting ... hm , i've always got tested as ravenclaw and can relate most to them , but i can see why you might say that . it's pretty true . we would already know beforehand of your internal struggles and probably guessing when you might finally ask the question . if that is so , then i see no reason why you should have any doubts . my mother is akin to a leaking bomb with a glitchy detonator , whereas my father is basically a potato . i take it that you speak from personal experience . have you taken the mbti test at least a few times ?
