im going to send this to my boss lol he'll understand . oh my god this is so fucking cathartic to me . when you said i fail at typing i thought what did i misspell ? lol . no , i know this infj well . he uses sharpie to fill in the gray hairs in his sideburns . one time i was in an infj's house , and they left for a moment . so i made all the pictures hanging on the walls slightly crooked , i unfluffed the couch pillows , i wrinkled the rug slightly , i opened a ... lol that's pretty accurate . i remember when you made the most average-ass lasagna ever , and then gloated about how good it was for an entire week after . shit had zuchinni chunks and ricotta cheese in ... ok that's fair but entp you know i like to play guitar as much as you do but you would never let me touch your precious banjo . and i would sit on the floor and listen to you cover fucking radiohead ... entp , i dated one of you . thought you were comletely normal and then a couple months in you fucking tell me you believe in reptilian humanoids . your avatar is interestingly sort of coincidental . how do you fit and differ from istp stereotypes ? i'm kind of hot headed , not the mello-ist person . also am more orderly than sterotypical also , have you grown up being misunderstood or feeling ...
