:P i consider myself to be feminine and i am that way because that is how i choose to be . i can weld , milk cows , paint rooms , refinish doors , change my own oil ... so here i am , a perfectly happy little entj working on my plans for world domination and i decided it would be a good time to talk my mother into actually taking the mbti . it turns out she's an ... well , you do want to have the business-minded folks ... but you also want a mediator on your team . someone who can help keep the humanity in the entj steam rollers . while we can analyze and keep ... vent away , get it out of your system so you can let it go . personally , doesn't sound like it was much fun for a trip . people like that irritate the crap out of me and then i tend to get a little ... i do have a temper . previous to the loss of my abusive husband i rarely lost my temper though . i tend to be very even emotionally and don't really see the point in wasting a bunch of energy on a ... yup . :) i know i am . oh my goodness ... a new fresh and sparkly entj ... come on in ! yay . i've been waiting days and days for a new entj :P ooo you are a spicy meatball ... tasty : tongue : so provide us with some examples . fluff is nothing but a waste of space . give me something concrete to work with ... or ... oh wait , are you doing it by ... sensing their personal auras ?
