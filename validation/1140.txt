' i recently remade my last.fm . not that this will be much better . i'm into pop punk , post-hardcore , indie , rock and emo , including : dikembe , a great big pile of leaves , enter shikari , bloc party , ... i bought it way back when it was beta ( 1.2 i think ) and i think the moment you first play it , and you're still trying to work out what everything does is the fun part . i still come back to it , but i ... nah , i didn't like that at all . sorry . damn , that was amazing . i love tapping on a guitar , it just sounds incredible . i'm one step ahead of you , i've already cleared out my wardrobe . in the past 3 months i've made a £ 400 + profit . but now i've run out of stuff to sell . i'm looking into buying and reselling in areas ... this was taken last night . excuse the dirty mirror ... and what is my mouth doing ? not exactly a man , only being 16 , but whatever . i know it's impossible to make a huge sum of money in one go , but has anyone got any tips for generating an extra cash flow by doing anything online ? i'd just like to get maybe £ 5 extra each week ... damn i love that guitar riff . skip to 2:13 for some amazing bass playing . these guys were all 16/17 when this was released . real ; bizarre documentaries , e . g , ' the man with 10 - stone testicles ' how it's made storage hunters pawn stars comedy ; never mind the buzzcocks sagittarius istp . they've been put together a few times , but with no real reasoning as to why . like someone said before , although my zodiac description fits me to a certain extent , i still think ... if the comment is from someone i like ( but not a close friend or family ) then i will feel slightly hurt , but i probably wont show it . i'll more than likely forget about it a few hours later . if ... i love tera melos . i prefer the song sunburn , but all of their stuff is brilliant . bumping with more math rock . the guitar work in this is incredible . i wish i could tap . ... damn , i loved that so much ! shame it's not on spotify . some of their other stuff is though , so i'm definitely checking that out . enjoyed it more than most stuff i've listened to in this thread . instrumentally it was okay . didn't really like the vocals though . when i'm alone , nothing . when i'm surrounded by people , everything . not keen on that .. i feel bad for not liking anything people post in this thread ... not really digging that ... it's a bit too .. empty for me ? if that makes sense ? again , i can totally understand why some people might like it , but it really isn't for me . also , just noticed that ... i can appreciate the talent , but it's not for me .. sorry . there are 63,279 people in the u . s . with my first name . there are 207,846 people in the u . s . with my last name . there are 42 people in the u . s . with the same full name . i don't live in the ... no song above . listening to music . if not that , taking it out on other people verbally usually helps me , as bad as it sounds . i don't raise my voice or anything .. i use snide remarks that remind me how quick ... it's complicated . in regards to science , i love biology the most , shortly followed by chemistry , with physics coming in last . i love maths more than biology . it's also the only thing i'm ... being an actual mechanic is one of the last careers that i would ever want to choose . i do , however , enjoy taking things apart and seeing how they work , with a mechanical mindset . if someone initiates the conversation i can go on for hours ... but i wont start it myself .  i don't flat out lie , i tend to exaggerate . when i have tried to lie though , i've failed miserably . i'm forever getting reminded of the time when i was 11 years old and i was half an hour late ... william bonney / / drug lord i hate everyone that i know , then i wonder x93where did my friends go ? x94 fucking poor me , always suffering . everyone will let me down , one way or the other . one day ... nope . i've ripped people to shreds though . cheveyo i love that link in your signature so much . love that song and portal . regarding the op ; both are important . the melodies and harmonies definitely need to interest me , but i like the ... in my main circle of friends there is 6 of us , including me , and we usually all meet up together and do things like play golf and things like that . sometimes 3 of us will meet up together just to ...  title is self-explanatory . there's nothing special about mine . it's just the name of a song called well fed by a band called a million ways . i put the two words together and replaced the second ... balance and composure / / fade leaning on the edge this time pacing back and forth i find that i can't get it right steady on my troubled mind bitter tasting words like why did i never write ... i'm the same . i don't know why but i just like seeing all these different names of artists / bands . and i get a tiny bit excited when i see someone listening to a band that i like that nobody else ... i wouldn't say i have social anxiety , but i certainly feel uncomfortable in social situations , and can't bear meeting new people , especially if i've spoken to them before ( but not face to face ) . if ... i always like there to be background noise , but i don't feel uncomfortable or bored in silence . situational , observational and satire get me the most . also , i find something a lot funnier when i'm part-way through laughing and suddenly think to myself i am such a bad person . slapstick very ... anyone that isn't extremely eccentric . does anybody here use last.fm ? link yours here . if you go on your profile and scroll down to your top artists , you should see a button on the right saying paste your taste . click that , then you ... yes , i like chunk ! no , captain chunk ! not really into that at all . sorry . this song just makes me want to throw down . emotion . it obviously needs to sound good too , but the more emotion , the better . 8/ 10 . i do love a bit of hardcore music . not familiar with them at all , but i'll check out more of their stuff , that's for sure . i'll carry on the hardcore with a pretty popular hardcore song and ...
