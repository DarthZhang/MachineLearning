' kyfra , you pretty much stated my thoughts on the subject exactly . i am much better off when i'm single . i crave love , and when i'm in love i am insecure and miserable . when the relationship ends , ... obviously you are capable of empathizing . you told us already that this aunt was like a mother to your mom , so you realize what an important relationship this was to her . when someone close to us ... when i'm under a lot of stress and not really being myself , i test infp , but the rest of the time as infj . i am definitely infj . i came from an exceptionally large family (8 kids ) , and have my own exceptionally large family . one of my daughters is infj , and i am , too . she also has a ton of younger brothers . she and i both ... sometimes i wonder how much of it is strictly biological - the woman's search for the strongest , most aggressive men to have babies with . susan sarandon , upon breaking up with tim robbins , said ... it is through love that i feel i find my soul ... for me , love is completely a spiritual / religious experience . have you read sufi poetry ? so spiritual , and so much of it is about love . hafiz , ... when i fell in love the first time , i felt i found the man who could reside within my soul . it was ( and is ) a heartbreaking experience ... i don't know if i could ever love anyone like that again . no , that is not actually what i meant . why not save yourself all sorts of time and not comment in threads you didn't read ? i don't get the point in insisting your life is so busy and your time too ... i saw some references to metaphors in another thread , and wanted to ask you all about it . i love metaphors . so often it's the only way to really communicate something . why do you suppose that ... i have been in long distance relationships , and the guy had nothing to worry about . he had my whole heart , and i never looked elsewhere . as for past relationships - eventually i do fully get over ... one of my favorite people in the world is infp . i think sometimes i drive her crazy , she worries that she drives me crazy , but the coolest thing about her is that she doesn't mind when i overanalyze ... i am so sorry . you didn't get what was coming to you . you loved him , and there is nothing shameful in loving someone . ha ! i totally missed that line of text . silly me ! but that guy isn't dangerous , except to himself . he's thrill-seeking . the only danger in loving a thrill-seeker , is that you might end up a young widow . that makes perfect sense to me . i'm like that with people that i don't have a really close relationship with in the first place . did you read the whole topic ? i'll have to think about this in terms of isfj . i have known people like that , and it's just foreign to me . i find it really annoying . i want to say , but just last week he was the biggest jerk on ... i don't think by dangerous men i meant the same thing that you're describing here . also , i think there are lots of different approaches to problem solving , not just two . i was married for 20 years . i have learned to give 2nd , 3rd , 4th , etc . , chances . for me to do that , once someone has truly , really screwed up , is : 1 . honesty - i need the person to be ... better than just meeting you halfway - i'm sure someday you'll meet someone you like who thinks your quirks are really cool . just like there are women who like complicated men , there are men ... the only way i read tarot is through empathy . i feel what they're feeling , then , through examining that feeling , find the details of the issue at hand . for me , the empathy comes first . it's why an ... i just cannot imagine an infj being not empathetic . one of my daughters is infj . she can be counted on to cry watching things like the youtube video of korea's got talent where the guy talks about ... i know they are cheating , but then want to believe i'm just overly paranoid . i need proof , absolute proof that they are lying and cheating . so ... after some time of telling myself i'm just insecure ... ok . but ... just look at all those symptoms . dry skin , low heart rate , etc . cause you can have thyroid problems but still test normal on the blood tests . it has to do with the body putting itself in ... oh , and yeah . coffee is life . peer , if you have low blood pressure , is your body temp low , too ? check your body temp with a glass thermometer . if it's also low , then you need to get your thyroid checked . wilson's ... for me , you could add , let her know you want her , then step back and give her space to get to know you and make up her mind . do not let her see you checking out or pursuing other women in the hopes ... ya . when getting dressed in the morning i will make my kids decide which outfit to wear . about twice a week . i work behind a computer at a place where no one cares what i look like . i've also brought ... i am the opposite - i open up very quickly about some things . and it therefore seems like i've opened up more than i actually have . there are just so many layers , and some of them are pretty ... when i'm trying to decide something , or need to find a solution to something , i think and think and think about it . i pull up all the random bits of related information and re-examine them , and ... i agree with almost all those bullet points completely , in regards to myself , at least . this is awesome . some people aren't worth the energy , you're right . i had a bf many years ago who cheated on me the entire time . after i broke up with him , he saw me with my new bf who was very , very , ... no lie . the guy i was so madly in love with could not understand that about me . when i finally took revenge , it shocked him . utterly shocked him . from his pov , hurting someone out of neglect or ... i feel like i know and accept myself . i also know that with new experiences , i will change my mind about things , and see things differently . just because i know who i am today doesn't mean i won't be ... cyborg vulcan ? i see potential for danger there . ;) yeah , i saw that . and felt a little guilty about it . i think part of it is that i'm pretty odd . there are lots of layers . i've lived in a lot of places and done a lot of things , and some of them ... i'm mostly thrilled that you wrote this : i like to think there is hope for me . heh actually , i did meet a person a great deal like my ideal . i was not prepared to deal with him the way he ... yes . the one guy i really had trouble getting over told me i knew him in a way no one else ever had . he told me i knew his soul . actually , i can say that about my ex husband , too . only one other ... yes . you got it ! as a mother , i can state this is true . as a woman , i can also state there is nothing wrong with fantasy and desire . usually changing diapers and wiping noses isn't part of the fantasy . oh , but i want them to look at me and want me to have their babies . heh charlotte bronte - intuitive . emily bronte - sensor . nickelback . that's sensor . nickelback lyrics - figured you out nickelback lyrics - gotta get me some one of my kids is esfj . he's a brilliant artist , but he works mostly with sculpture . he plays keyboards , draws , does 3d modelling , too . but his sculptures are amazing . his art is physical , as ... i would say esfj . i'm not a fan of his . he seems so ... earthy . in a way that makes nice girls like me really uncomfortable . that's all i'm basing it on . heh just having seen videos and getting ... wouldn't you say david lee roth is a sensor ? but , overall , i do agree . most of the writers i love , at least , would be intuitives . i have had some relatively long periods in life where i was much more extroverted . ( long periods as in 9 months or maybe a year or two . ) but always , always , it reverts back to the need for lots of ... i've done sales and fundraising . i do much , much better at fundraising . in fact , i worked at a place where people could buy for themselves - or buy to donate to others . when i couldn't get them to ... um ... yeah . the one scenario you can count on seeing me really scary in , is if i think some adult has mistreated one of my kids . i sent my kid to the counter at a fast food restaurant since they ... i don't know for sure , but i think he's enfp , though he may be entp . he is very popular with other kids , younger kids especially like him . he's sunny , affectionate , sweet , and fun , but greek ...
