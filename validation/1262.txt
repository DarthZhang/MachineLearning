' anyone wondering about night in the woods ? i didn't look through all the posts here but i was considering starting a thread on it because it's a really good game and i think the characters are ... also , for fun ( and since i'm in it ) , betty from glitchtale ( online animated series ) is probably esxp . she's kind of the personification of fear so it's a little hard to type but judging from her ... reviving this thread because i recently realized something . okay , so i'm an alphys voice actress . official one of strelok audio , playing her in a musical , playing her for a comic dub series , etc ... my entp ex wanted me to be kinky but i'm not . like at all . i'm not sure if it's because i'm an enfp or i'm asexual . probably the latter , come to think of it ... all the nfs i know find sjws annoying and ridiculous . but i might just have really intelligent friends . i'm asexual so no , definitely not . if i'm going to act on the minimal attraction i have and attempt to nurture it , i want it to be long term . i'm not interested in relationships that won't last . my ideas come to me in a variety of ways . sometimes it's through conversation . others just pop into my head at a moment's notice . and sometimes i find little tidbits of knowledge i'd like to share ... lately i've been feeling mentally drained 90 % of the time and i'm starting to think that might be pretty typical for enfps . or maybe just me . i'm not sure so i'll elaborate . if i get a new idea ... ... and he's a pretty nice guy but he really likes debating me . i've got nothing against a spirited debate but honestly , i'm usually not feeling up for it and he makes me feel like i need to be on the ... based on people i know . intp : your sadistic sense of humor either cracks me up or makes me worried about your sanity . regardless , i like your wit and i like that we can have deep conversations ... i'd have posted this in their individual boards but they're not as popular as the nt and nf boards and it might have gotten buried . and i want feedback from everyone who can offer it , not just the ... in my experience , the enfp in love loses all common sense and rationality . i've had it happen to me and i endured it for a portion of time last year when my enfp bestie had a boyfriend for 2 months ... i'm surprised no one has brought up jacksepticeye . i've watched an embarrassing number of his videos over the last few months and i'm pretty sure he's an esfp . i started drawing 2 months ago today and i have to say that i'm pretty pleased with where it's going . all i can do are characters from undertale though . i have unpopular undertale ships so i have ... the only youtubers i follow are jacksepticeye and nostalgia critic and i agree with the general consensus that the nc is entp ( as a character , i'm not sure what doug is but i always thought he was an ... heythererock if flowey is a screwed up enfp , it would make sense for asriel to be a healthy one . i kind of thought flowey was intj , kind of prefers to watch you and try to predict your behavior , but ... true but frisk is also vague in terms of back story and motivation . s / he's meant to be a self insert , which means technically you could substitute any type for him / her . the dialogue boxes for him / her ... reviving because i love this discussion and joined the party a bit late ( is there any leftover spaghetti ? no ? ) . okay so anything i say about frisk will have far more to do with the way i played them ... all right , let me see if i can weigh in here . i noticed no one has attempted to type chara , flowey , or asriel ( flowey and asriel being different entities , in my opinion ) . alphys could be an ... writing is my favorite thing ever but when i got started , i was awful at it and i found it boring and not at all fun . and then i started meeting people who also liked to write and who thought i had a ... one of my best friends is an infp and she hates everyone with few exceptions . another of my best friends is an enfp who loves everyone with a few exceptions . i fall somewhere in the middle . i think ... tumblr . : cool : just kidding , though i know quite a few on that site . honestly , it all depends . we like to do artistic projects so look for us in writing groups , art shows , and theaters . we ... i've known both types fairly well and i have to say that i have no idea . i'm a total shut-in as an enfp but my best friend is also enfp and she's very outgoing and loves to hang out with friends and ... my sister says my eyes are my best feature . so maybe there's something to this whole enfp eyes thing . here's me with my enfp bestie . i'm the one on the left . do we both have enfp eyes ? 446450 well judging by the stories i've written , i guess i'd be a villain who plans for a ton of variables and changes it every time there's an issue . my evil plan would be adaptable and my ability to guess ... another writing question ! how is an isfj / esfp relationship ? what are the benefits and downsides ? what would an isfj like about an esfp and vice versa ? so this is a good bromance pair . perfect ! yeah , i'm best friends with a female infj and when we're together or with close friends , she can be the life of the party . loudest one in the room and the ... i've gotten to writing a bromance between an infj and an esfp . it's completely ridiculous and a lot of fun . i've taken to giving the infj the straight man role because the esfp is a dork who ... i'm not a very good speaker and people don't usually care about what i have to say . but i'm a good writer . and ironically , i'm good at writing dialogue . currently crushing on an intj . my two previous serious crushes were an entp and esfp . oh , you're invading ? that's nice . i love all intuitives , make yourself at home . do you want some cookies ? please excuse the mess , i've got better things to do than tidy up . like talk obsessively ... it's a long story and it has to do with the culture of his time but he sees her getting pregnant at 17 out of wedlock as an attack on his family's name and flies off the handle after 2 years of being ... one of my best friends is another enfp and she's on the outgoing side . she still loves to read and be alone for long periods of time . too much social activity drains her . it's the same with me and ... i used to be really offended . now people have a reason to hate me . oh well . go right on ahead and hate me . now if someone i care about were to suddenly hate me , that would be a different story . question for an estp character i know i've prattled on and on about but this is making me think : would an estp bottle resentment or not communicate what he wants from people ? bear in mind , mine is ... he's a jerk and probably a narcissist . a narcissistic entp is poison to an enfp . dump him ! he sounds a lot like my college room mate . family is well off , seems to have a zillion reasons to brag , acts like a nice guy except he's really not . i hated her and i probably wouldn't like this guy ... no , it's not that i don't think istjs can be creative , it's more that i don't tend to run into many and there isn't much discussion on the subject . i find the imaginative and creative side of you ... it depends entirely on the friend . i have some i could tell anything . i have other people in my life that i wouldn't trust with what i like on a sandwich , much less my innermost thoughts and ... my adopted sister is an infp 4w5 . i'm an enfp 4w5 . naturally , we have a lot in common and tend to be on the same wavelength . it's great because we can understand where the other person is coming from ... my dad is an istj . he's also flexible with the way things are done and very creative . it seems paradoxical and i've never met another istj like him . but he's been officially confirmed as an istj . i ... i just need to get this out there . and i know it'll be a long post so if you're willing to read it and tell me what i'm supposed to do about this , that'd be nice . i'm your typical ne-dom from an ... will talk about character development in all forms of media for hours . matilda because i saw a lot of myself in her and her situation . something struck a chord with me about the movie and the book ( which is better than the movie ) . i discovered all of the things i hated about entps disappeared when i befriended a healthy one . never mind , you all are the best . unless you're unhealthy , then you're total jerks . this is probably the closest i can get to a definite motivation ; allie is telling hiccup's son finn why she was so brutal to hiccup during their so called friendly duel . well this is why i've asked for help . i've made her a total jerk already and i think she's either enfj or possibly esfj . if an esfj is more likely to go with revenge , then that's probably her type ... well as the plans for my final story have started to come together , i realized that the enfj jerk i'd been writing into my series would actually make a more interesting mastermind behind the ... i'm currently reading the first book but i think percy is estp . then again , he's also 12 so his second function may not be completely formed yet . annabeth seems intj and grover isfj . maybe . i'm not ... it hasn't been done yet and i know it just came out but as that was a psychologically fascinating movie , what do you think were the types represented ? i don't actually have guesses for all of them ...
