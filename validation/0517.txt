everyone is entitled to bad days . oh i would agree , yes . she does have some very valid points , and am not offended either . mostly i'm here trying to learn about these types , but as an intp can't because i see an emotional motive ... i have uncovered the emotional motive behind the article . author states in one of her other blog posts : infjs seem like some of the most promising people to be in a relationship with , but in ... but how can the infp writing this be the nicest people on earth if he / she is calling infjs assholes ? ! logic fail . : confused : yes , i pull back for a week or two if it's starts to get worrisome again . but when i do regain control over my thoughts , i make an effort to communicate more regularly . always at least once a week , ... that is tough , but i do it all the time too in one of my long distance friendships . almost like a short panic if a message isn't responded to . im not exactly skilled in evaluating emotions ( secret ... you could play online games together ( multi-player ) . there are even several multi player apps for your phone : solitaire , scrabble , etc you and me both ... will let you know when i figure this out too . to me the dating games all seem ridiculous anyway ( not fun , what is the point ) + trust issues = this wall is double barricaded ... with ... incredibly logical answers ?
