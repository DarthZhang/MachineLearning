what emotions ? ! i'm just playing , well sort of . i suffer from ptsd , so i rarely feel too much . and when i am having a really shitty night , i usually remember my traumatic experiences , ... how old were you when you got married ? how long did it take you to want to marry the person ? what mbti type did you married ? and what enneagram type were they ? are you divorced , and if so ... haha i saw that , and i totally agree ! oh god yes ... i was once told my mind was as filthy and corrupt as a us marine .. thats interesting . i worked at a electronic store , and there were a lot of intj men there . but hmph , environmental sciences is the well for intj women ... i have only met one intj woman .. really 4 at one work place ? may i ask what you do because intj women aint that common bro ! well the person also said that this trait can be used for good , like maybe in my career i should do something where people need acceptance , but they'd also realize i have boundaries ( because i do ) ... 1 . are estps generally secretive ?

because she was your friend a couple of months ago right ? so mope around , think of what she'd probably react ... yeah i am often called mean too . one of my friends said that if she didn't know me , she'd probably think i am the most insensitive bitch ever . > . < idk what the common estp friend is , i have a lot of ... istj who not , who cares ! just try ! ! ! just do it and see what happens . what can you loose ? a friendship you already don't have right now ? my friend did the whole , im gonna write you off over txt , when we've been friends for 12 years . i ... well a friend and i were talking about this . and he thinks its because my mom was schizophrenic , so i had learn to adapt very quickly to whatever mood she was in . and in that i have learned to be ... well thats cool , never met a intj who was into the health field . but ya know , do what ya want :P an intj nurse ?
