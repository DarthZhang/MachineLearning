' i'm 21 and i first found out about the mbti when i was 8 ( my infp ex-stepmom is a therapist and is into the mbti : tongue :) . she typed me as an istj but i don't think i actually took the test until ... that's not necessarily true . i know of a lot of people ( females and males ) who don't want to have kids , but would like to get married . i'm sure , if you wanted to , you could find someone who shares ... our ( istj ) lack of touchy feely-ness definitely can be an issue - - i met my current best friend in senior year of high school and i only hugged him once that entire year ( the day after graduation , ... is this where your obsession with enfps started ? : tongue : exactly ! for me , if i decided to marry someone then it wouldn't be a decision that i came to lightly . and i don't mean in the usual way that people have to decide whether they're ready to commit or ... narco , i have the same objective when looking for a boyfriend - - if he's not someone that i could see being my husband ( as in , he has the personal values that i look for in a person ) then i won't ... uh huh :p roud : i was at iupui before and now i'm at iu ! hi john ! :) this is true . :p roud : i'm from indianapolis , but just this year i moved to bloomington . : wink : johnnyguitarman : sure , i'd be interesting in hearing your music ! i like animals ! : laughing : i have a pet dog ( a papillon ) and i love him . i definitely would have another pet ( dog or cat ) if i could afford to spend more money on one and afford to spend more time ... honestly i think it would take a lot for me to even consider divorce , like an extreme circumstance - i . e . him hitting me or something . if i make a commitment to someone as serious as marriage , then i ... i rarely ever drink ( and i didn't even get around to drinking on my 21st birthday ) but i will have one or two drinks now socially when i go out . however , i don't do shots or anything like that and ... how am i ( an istj ) creative ? * creative writing - i like to write stories and i was very into screenwriting for a long time ( and was told by peers and professors that i'm quite good at it - - ... my best friend is an infj ! : laughing : what i think about him : he's extremely intuitive ( and prides himself on that among other things , haha ) , he's an artist but doesn't really like other art ... 1 . i'm exactly the same way - if someone wants me to know that they like me , then they'll need to spell it out and say it bluntly ... otherwise i just won't know . so , yes , i'm definitely socially ... i'm the exact same way - - adverse to using social networking sites / messengers . which basically means if the person isn't physically nearby , then there's a good chance we'll lose contact . : unsure : ... welcome to personalitycafe ! : laughing : yay ! i look forward to finding out . :p roud : finding out how well different types interact with each other , always intrigues me . istj , here ! * waves * : laughing : sugarfix , out of curiosity , do you know what type your husband is ( or if he would take the test ) ? : happy : ... just curious . i understand and appreciate your suggestion , but i just don't think that's likely to happen . i'm all for saying hey i like spending time with you , we should do it more often ( in fact , i plan to say ... oooh , that makes more sense . so why are you in the esfp group ( or , at least , that's what it says under your username ) ? the only problem is ... i don't really talk about my feelings ... ever ( like , not even with my parents or people i'm really close friends with ) . i'm not sure why it's so difficult for me , but it ... another female istj ? yay ! :p roud : welcome to personalitycafe , sugarfix ! off-topic ( sorry ) but ... are you sure that you're an esfp ? : mellow : i ask , mostly because this doesn't sound very esfp to me . yes , this is exactly my problem . usually when i befriend extroverts , they'll make it obvious that they like me and want to be my friend , then we'll do something together that same day / night / weekend ... happy response = good sign ( yay ! ) . at least i know i can still interpret the obvious when it comes to emotions , hehe . :p roud : i suppose that's true ( about the invitations ) since , as a fellow shy ... the last new movie i watched : slumdog millionaire the last actual movie i watched : before sunrise : happy : thanks for responding ! i hope you're right . : mellow : i just called him and said that i would go ( and he sounded really happy and kind of surprised when i told him ... so that's a good sign , yes ? ): happy : well i talked to him this morning during ( and after ) class , but i forgot to ask him about the party . however , he did kind of invite me to go with him to a lecture / discussion on international foreign ... i guess , i just assumed it would be a big party with lots of friends and loud music . otherwise why would he mention the part about his roommate being out of town for the weekend ? would he really have ... after thinking about it more , i've finally come to the conclusion that he really doesn't feel strongly toward me either way ( he probably feels something like , if we become good friends , fine . if ... maybe ... but considering the party is with his friends , i'm sure he's comfortable with them . : tongue : or maybe not , haha . thanks for the input , though ! actually , i grew up an army brat and so i've known a lot of military people ( some older , some peers , and some in different areas of the military - marines , airforce , navy , etc . ) and about 90 % of ... that's okay . all advice is appreciated . : laughing : i feel the same way . even when i have gone to parties in the past with close friends , i still don't have very much fun . i'd rather just be at ... thanks ! i'm relieved to know that i'm not the only person who feels that way about parties . as for the excuse ... do i need one ? can i just tell him that the party scene really isn't for me , and ... yeah , i'm definitely taking all the advice with a grain of salt . the other day i seemed more confident about him wanting to be friends but honestly i'm still unsure . today the isfj guy , finally ... thanks for your input . yeah , i definitely think i'm going to have to just suck up my shyness and go ahead and take the initiative . i would hate to lose something that could turn into a good ... i understand this . i could feel that there is a connection between us and the potential for a good friendship , but he may not feel the same way . i definitely accept that . thanks for your opinion ... oh i understand now , thanks ! that's true , i hadn't thought about it like that before . that's a good point . i do think that it would bother me if i was the one who constantly had to take the ... i just first wanted to say thank you for giving me your perspective . i'm an introvert so i didn't think it'd be that hard to figure out a introverted male ... but it definitely is a lot more difficult ... haha is it ? the office supplies store used to be my favorite place as a kid . then , when i was 19 , i worked there for the summer . in the interview i told them how much i used to ( but still ) love it ... haha , i thought so . but all the types have flaws . like with me ... if someone expects me to hug them and go into detail about my love and feelings for them on a daily basis , then they'll be sorely ... i think the bolded part is the problem . with some of the intj's i've known , they can seriously hold a grudge . then they end up remaining isolated from that person . with time , they don't deal with ... haha yeah ... not many of us around , unfortunately . : bored : i do this all the time . everything else i don't really do ( except for the mom & flowers thing one time ) . :p roud : this would annoy me . . . not make me feel the love : tongue : and if a person did ... i'm the same . as long as i'm prepared for the questions , i can speak confidently and without hesitation . but if they ask me something i didn't prepare for , then i'll definitely have to pause for a ... haha . so true ... : tongue : welcome to the forum , naydra ! hmm ... when i was a kid i wanted to be a lawyer . i also loved office supplies , so i definitely wanted to have a nice office of some kind . : wink : the exact same thing happened with me . i took this history course once and barely ever spoke in class . then we each had to give this big presentation , in a lecture hall filled with about 100 + ... wow ... yeah . i'd have to agree with this . i absolutely loved being friends with an intj , the intellectual conversation was very stimulating and enjoyable . but they hold a grudge like no other , and a ...
