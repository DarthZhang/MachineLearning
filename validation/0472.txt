' to build a home - cinematic orchestra not a recent discovery , but i have been absolutely in love with it for years . it's wonderful . estp most likely to be a weird mix of really caring and a total asshole at the same time ? i'm going to be organised and get this assignment done early . i actually googled this because i thought it was the exact opposite - i've noticed a lot of intuitives like songs because of the lyrics and a lot of sensors ( like myself ) like songs just because they ... ok so this started off with you being upset with her for saying everything is random ( which is kind of weird by the way , not entirely sure why you're offended by that ) but then it ended up with you ... isfp and have always gotten neutral good she probably needs you to be her friend like your friend was to you when you were going through a similar thing . just try your best to be there for her and talk to her when you can . i would tell your ... i've always assumed she was infj , cause didn't she base dumbledore off herself ? i've never known an istp to lie just to be nice . just because you didn't go well enough to get your dream career does not mean your life is over . there's always a way in . haven't you ever heard ' if there's a will , there's a way ' ? please don't kill ... i'm only 17 so far so i only have 17 numbers to go by but i'll give it a crack : worst age - 15 , what a fucking mess i was . felt sorry for myself 24/7 and complained too much for my own good , really ... mum : entj dad : entj me : isfp enfp from what i've gathered from intjs i've encountered , dishonesty seems to be something they really dislike . dream land fantasy : infp i think i saw enxp back there , so either way - i wish i was an enfp or entp ! both so fantastic , enfps are lovely and awesome and i haven't met one i don't like , and there is something really ... yes ! i swear even if i told someone every detail about my life they would still claim that i'm ' hard to read ' . you don't have to hate conflict to be an isfp - i don't hate it and i'm one . so i'm pretty certain harry potter is an isfp ! some more : lana lang - smallville maxxie - skins puss in boots - shrek ... well you're a bit of a douchebag aren't you . the point of this thread is to get everyone's individual opinion on which types you personally think are the most sensitive / insensitive , again i'm not ... i just meant as in which feeler you think is generally least sensitive towards other people , and which thinker might be the most sensitive towards others . it's a broad question because i'd like to ... just curious here , and i swear i am not trying to offend you in any way at all , but are you talking about one or a couple of enfjs that you may have had bad experiences with , or enfjs as a whole ? but seeing as enfjs are fe users , wouldn't that mean the opposite ? it generally would be the unhealthy fi users that would only care about themselves wouldn't it ? aw , poor guy . i'm the only isfp in a family full of entjs and estjs . i feel for him haha . i wouldn't say ' obviously ' - those sites often get the celebrity types wrong . how likely is this combination ? one of my friends is most definitely an intj , but he got 9 on the enneagram test ( can't remember the wing ) and it just seemed quite peculiar to me because i'm pretty ... all good , i like reading peoples opinions anyway :) what do you think the types of the wizard of oz characters would be ? i'm a 4w5 , close to being a 6 . not sure on the wing . i have a very , very love hate relationship with most of them . i'm really close friends with four intjs , one of which is my best friend , and one of which i had an extremely complicated relationship ... how about be a good friend and put up with it - he's obviously going through some shit and just because you don't like listening , doesn't mean you shouldn't . however , if it gets out of hand , just be ... well that doesn't sound douchey at all i think an unhealthy one can be yeah , they might be very selfish with their choices , or they might have some really twisted morals that might lead them to do pretty bad things , although probably with ... usually things that i find funny . sometimes shit that i'm feeling at the time but a few of my friends lurk my tumblr a lot so i have to limit those ones ! i love the lyrics to this one part of a song called you be the anchor that keeps my feet on the ground by mayday parade - and i'll be here by the ocean just waiting for proof that there's sunsets ... i've always thought that johnny depp was beautiful - especially in the 80s . is this an actual question dear intj , you're not always right . no , really , you're not . i know , it's shocking . but strangely enough , very true . sincerely , isfp . dear intj , you're not always right . no , really , you're not . i know , it's shocking . but strangely enough , very true . sincerely , isfp . ps . i was not aware this was an istp thread . i'll see ... jennifer lawrence , johnny depp ( i think it's more his attitude towards most things that i like about him , rather than his personality though ) , emma stone , and quite shamefully zac efron . don't judge ... definitely a senser ( from what you've said ) , i would say a thinker most likely , so overall my best guess is estj . not sure on the judging function though . these were both already drawings , so i only copied them . and they were in pen so i'm sorry they're pretty dodgy haha , was just bored and this was just a bit of fun for me . 63313 63314 also ... i know i played it ! ! and finished it haha the room ! best worst movie ever . oh or birdemic . estj . someone saying i'm a coward or selfish are two of the worst things i think someone could say to me , it would be awful . or that i'm stupid . isfj , no doubt about it . i've read the first one , it's amazing . i highly recommend you read it . i'm not quite sure on the types of the characters , but here are my best guesses : tris : istp four : istj ? i don't even know ...
