! this is something i struggle with . sometimes it seems like my istp is not enthusiastic about something i suggest because he says sure to almost everything . and so i ... ahhh ! i'm glad you have that in a friend ! i most definitely feel that way about my istp friends . i see and feel that they are equally as caring , not necessarily as sensitive , but there is this ... g'rawr ! can i just say i feel the warmest of fuzzies for you ? and i wish you the best ! yes ... i have some control issues . i like to * know * a lot of things and sometimes no matter how many ... goodness ! i can see now why things in my relationship have played out the way they have ! haha too true ... there have been times where i despaired because i kept running into many layers of emotional ... it makes me so sad , particularly on the istp facebook group , that there's so much hostility towards enfjs as a type . my guess is that they have only come across immature and uncompromising enfjs in ... also : after having my very first conversation with an infj within the passed two days . i was wholly unaware of the typing at first but we kept going back and forth , very surface level . kind of like ... did i answer your question ? or should i think about this further , elaborate and / or clarify ? smallpeas that's interesting , this sense of reciprocity you speak of . perhaps we are that much more sensitive to rejection . our idea of self is partly related to how we are evaluated by those ... agreed . and like ringer said we want to be trusting . i want to talk to everyone that will listen to me about my innermost thoughts and feelings . seriously , if i could i would . but not everyone is ... both . i don't wear my heart on my sleeve . my heart is tougher to reach and is only given when someone is deemed safe . positive emotions like happiness , excitement and wonder , and confidence i let ... ha ! i love your responses ! i was mostly quiet and always observing adults and listening to their conversations . around my family members i always asked why , but my dad's side of the family was ... i second the request for a specific example . i also ask tons of questions dancing around an answer to a question i'm thinking of , but not the actual question , which to others would appear as ... furry pajama pants : they're like hugs for your legs ! ahahaha ! this is exactly what my istp says . i've got a little ways to go in the self-confidence department which eventually stabilizes the batshit craziness of the enfj . watching me progress from a ... you know , i don't believe age has anything to do with emotional maturity . cognitive development , yes , but i have seen some very stable young people that have it more together than those in their ... i can just imagine my poor counselor ! he / she will probably just feel totally bull-dozed . here are my problems , i don't need help identifying them . here are my childhood traumas that led me to ... ooh ! freezeframe , i do have friends that i talk to but we're in the same boat and kinda run ourselves in circles ... the other one i'm pretty sure is a highly functioning sociopath , to quote sherlock ... isolation is needed to a certain extent to introspect , yes . but what do you do to prevent yourself from introspecting too much and mood-swinging all over the place ? just ... pep-talk yourself ? niffer it's good to know i'm not actually crazy and it just seems like it when comparing myself to relatively unreactive istps - . - not so good that you're going through it too ... i just have hope ... for the past two years it seems like my life has been completely shaken up and i haven't been able to find my center of gravity . i met a man , fell in love , broke up but we are still emotionally ... i think that how much an nfj reveals to you and how quickly definitely has to do with maturity and experience dealing with different types of people ; i'm even more convinced . i understand what is ... i think the lack of trust presently arises from experiences since childhood . * * i really dislike speaking for the entirety of the enfj population because i am only one person , so forgive me for ... crikey ! that's exactly what i've been trying to get at . thank you for being more succinct . ahhh , i see where your confusion would come in . * i * happen to be a really assertive female . i choose my men , not the other way around and over the years i've learned to just tell who i'm interested ... which is why the golden rule of thumb for knowing if you can trust is , is whether or not we can trust you ! if we open up to you , chances are we won't hide our feelings - - at least not ... smallpeas sometimes i don't know my own feelings about things . or concepts . but i know how i feel about people after reflecting . also in response to how do you know if i'm acting on my feelings ... success stories ?
