( we were playing , right ? ... right ? ) count me in ! frankly i always hear about one , but i really haven't noticed a stigma toward us . i might just be naive , or it might just be in our heads , considering we can be very insecure on the whole . ...  i agree in part with your friends ; after the first paragraph it gets too metaphorical and a bit hard to follow . however , if you're in the right mindset and really mull it over as a reader , it does ... wow , yeah , i just checked out their forum . i don't want to insult them or anything ( i guess it's just the way they see the world ? ) , but i can see where the ... friction comes from . mad world . either version . don't care . the worst person ! i really don't want to talk to you right now . really , the ability to laugh without it being at another person's expense . and being interested in cultural stuff . y'know , the strongest crush i've ever had , i just basically quoted anchorman ... self-hatred : about half the time . the other half is pretty okay , i can do this , i just need a chance . insecurity : yes and forever . there's never been a time when i haven't been afraid of ... well , that's sort of the point . people do treat it like an accusation . why do i keep getting in trouble for using hyperbole ? i have a pretty effeminate body language , and have been called out as gay on it before ( albeit not recently ) . i'm always embarrassed by it . don't let anybody call you out for skipping , though . ... i can't add anything that wouldn't be a restatement of this . it's very good advice . ( though , frankly , i don't think you have to love math to get any better at it . i wouldn't know what advice to ... i fancy myself a writer , but i hardly ever start anything because i'm so nervous about getting it right before i get in too far deep . maybe we need a writing encouragement thread for us nervous ... i really enjoy journey to the west and the arabian nights . both so magical , with so much variety and ... just , setting ! i would if i had art to give . : bored : is there a writing thread around here ? almost exactly this . if i'm awake and can bake cookies at 2am , i do so . not from scratch , but just in the little pre-cut sheets or those tubs of dough or something easy like that . because fuck it , ... i assume our signature messiness comes with a bit of smelliness , yes . : laughing : i love stuff like this . in fact , i have a program called q10 that's basically the same - - a good alternative , at least . you smell so nice all the time ! this might just be me . i was the worst . i can't believe i did half of the things i did . i framed people , insulted them on very racist terms , stuff like that - - all while feigning a good kid attitude toward adults . i'm ... what ? where ? who ? huh ? how ? when i was a kid , i was absolutely terrible . i'm talking from kindergarten , first grade up to sixth . i was annoying , calculating , cruel , obnoxious , crazy , stupid , and so much more . i never had ... really , it's only human to want a bit of comeuppance . not like she's dead or injured or anything - - it might just be a bit of the old what goes around comes around . i do recommend that , if you ... kingdom come was fantastic . honestly , i tend to like dc elseworlds and alternative canons than the main running comics - - all-star superman , justice league : the new frontier , red son . stuff like ... sands i was just trying to be clever and relevant by corrupting a quote from the movie it , which is where her avatar comes from . didn't seem to work . : bored : hello and welcome to perc ! we all float down here ! nobody really cares or knows about dc's greatest characters besides dc fans . the spirit , the question , ambush bug , the sandman - - there are so , so many more . this , too . besides , you can never be an alpha male for all of your life - - someday you will grow old and weak . rainy time . any time . well , so long as i'm indoors . hate getting wet in the rain sometimes . other than that , night time . again , so long as i'm indoors . i hate the outdoors at night . haha , i'm farther down the scale than i first thought , actually . i think i'm honestly depressed . say you're a boy , and there's a girl you like . she isn't great with this whole self-confidence thing . she , in an off-hand , yet slightly jokey comment while in a conversation with you , calls herself ... jesus , i know exactly how you feel . i've been feeling like this for basically the past year - - for similar reasons , too . i used to have so much to think about - - so many interesting things that i ...
