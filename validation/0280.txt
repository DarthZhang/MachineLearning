' well , i am an enfp who would never eat that crap ( again ) because it tastes like styrofoam . ( i won't eat that again either . ) lol . but i get the attraction . it's a whimsical novelty , that while ... i am an enfp . my husband is an entj . my ex-husband is an istj . together , we raised a really cool textbook intp ( just typed her last night ! ) what kinds of things would you intp's have ... lol ! let me prove your point re criticism : the message in quotes is what was responded to , which would have been addressing the intp ( unibomber ) . although its a fair mistake since neither of us share ... unibomber often , intp ? it's true ! i'd rather see an action - sci-fi or occasionally a great drama ... but not so much chick flicks and romantic comedies . the perfect movie would be a historical drama involving shakespeare ... also , she was once criticized for why eddie had to die . that he really didn't deserve that outcome . she answered that his character was represented as a good person with good intentions , a virtuous ... all of rand's heroes are introverts . all of her villains are extraverts . people sometimes confuse francisco with being an extravert because of his portrayal as a playboy partier , but remember ... just found this , and it's hilarious ! it makes fun of every type , and here's ours ! :-) ( i thought entj , istj , and intp were especially funny ! ) the real personality types made relevant ... ^ ^ ^ bahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! i own one pair of flats that i bought for wearing on the beach during our honeymoon , and i own 2 pair of fitflops . but even my tennis shoes have heels . entj women are statistically rare , and including both sexes , entj's make up only a tiny 2 % of the population . one evening last fall , toroom 101 was hosting a socratic discussion at a local wine bar ... boo on you ! ! ! i just had to scold him for this bit of tmi ! one time out of many dozens i was off my game , and it is memorialized in writing . booo ! ! ! love you . :-) my proof is the reasoning power of my own mind . what is , is , in objective reality . if an enfp understands this fact , surely it is not beyond the grasp of a sensor , schizophrenic or not . originally posted by mcfly what do lipstick tubes have to do with your ovulation cycle ? venitas : everything , of course . jealous ? ... i also accumulate art supplies . i enjoyed scrapbooking from 1994 until about 4 years ago when i discovered i could work much faster online . during my scrapbooking years , i accumulated enough ... the more important the meeting , the higher the heel ! power and sex appeal are in those magical platform stilettos ! a pair of jeans with a black tank top and a killer set of red heels ! ^ ^ ^ hahahahahahahahaha omg , me too ! ! ! i wonder if it's an enfp thing ? i'm obsessed ... with 4-5 net heels ! my entj has given me over 150 pair , and i have accumulated about 250 + pair total , and i'm beginning to strass ... you have a point ... all the talking , laughing , and peacocking with each other kinda blows the element of stealth . i am nokinakikutedoarichi . it's deadly to meet you . niss , your profile has been istj and suddenly flipped every letter this morning to enfp . was this a mistake , or did you have a damascus road experience last night ? :-p that is so interesting to me , because my ex-husband ( istj ) said essentially the same thing to my husband ( entj ) . they have formed a healthy friendship because of the family dynamics surrounding our ... no . not even a little bit . he scored 100 % e . i have always been the most extroverted person i have ever known in my life , and he is the one and only human being i have ever met who can wear me ... that way ? i'd ask you to follow me , entj , but i realize that i must first ask you which is the proscribed foot for taking the first step , and that you'd change the rules halfway there . so let's ... says the isfp who doth protest too much ... probably out of envy for not having created it yourself . :-p i am your goddess ! judging from the avatar , entj , i'd say ... god complex , anyone ? once upon a time , i was married to one of you ... for 17 years . maybe there are deviations among people , but at least he hardly ever spoke ! :-) what would two istj's talk about on a date ? would they talk at all ? what would a date between two istj's look like ? ? having known a number of istj men and women , my stereotype is : women feel uncomfortable looking like women . they button the top button , like turtlenecks , think any form of cleavage or curve is ... i can see the potential icy daggers turning in my direction ... so i'll try to run faster than they fly , if possible . lol i don't think that anything is inherently wrong or vacuous about the roles ... i love this so much , i am thinking of using it as my new signature ! :-D boss , that was awesome ! confounds abound ! obvious to some who muddled through a research design class or two ... not so much for those who were distracted by working out to optimize maximum maximus ... of course ! ! and that was exactly what i wanted in asking both groups ! to only gather an nf reaction is incomplete , bias-seeking , and disingenuous . part of what makes this so much fun is the ... omg ! ! ! can i just say copy and paste here ! ! ! you even used my own words ! ! ! i think this is where type watching becomes practically applicable . it would be a fallacy to assume that what validates and gives purpose to an enfp would be the same for an entj or for an isfj . ...  ... absolutely ! ! i love the entj and all of their particular beautiful quirkiness . i need them in my life , and even though i also need the healing spirit of other nf's from time to time , i could not be ... :-) been there ? that's the kitchen sinking tactic , and it really is irritating to be on the receiving end of it ! well , entj , if you would refrain from micromanaging and let your enfp work her magic in her own way , she might be more valuable than you have thus far experienced . i guarantee you that she has ... but liza , we kind of want to be , even when we don't want to be . especially with those we admire . and you know that's true ! :-p well darn . i can't figure out how to post links . ( go figure ! an enfp struggling with making technology perform according to desire ! ) :-) hey entj , don't you have something better to do ? like steal school lunches from children while you scream at them for not working hard enough to deserve benefits ? as an enfp who has been defined and put into a mother-box for most of my children's life , i feel stifled by the labels . i will never be the pta mom or the soccer mom . i am an individual too , and ... no . unless it's about all of the potential problems of you being together , your inadequacies , the unsustainability of the relationship , and general negativity ... which is his own way of testing to ... fascinating ! i still measured an enp , but in going back , i recognized that as i grew up , i moderated and became less e ( because i was so spastic that i was off-putting and ended up running people ... my husband and i were laughing out loud about that earlier ! i adore this comment ! it is so true ! we can not nor should we worry about pleasing everyone , but we are ultimately responsible for the way that we are perceived . we audition for roles in social ... i also believe you , and i understand where you are coming from . you sound like you have some similarities in this respect to my husband , who also values clarity and also does not intend to offend in ...
