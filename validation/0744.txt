i'm dating an istp who i feel must have a decently developed inferior fe , because he is way more polite and considerate than i could ever hope to be ... but i don't really know ... well , it mostly didn't make sense because he was drunk ... he started weaving the names of streets and stores we were passing into his metaphors . it was at about that time that i realized he was three ... several years late to the party ... but that is exactly what happened me and my istp ! it was hilarious ... i was all like , oh ? and just who are you in a relationship with ? and he was like , ... you ? i saw my istp boyfriend really drunk for the first time recently , and it was hilarious . i was driving him home and the whole time he was monologing about life and love - - unfortunately none of it made ... haha data points ... spoken like a true thinker ! it always cracks me up to hear life experiences discussed in a dispassionate , objective manner . one of the things that i don't like about the intjs ... that sounds exactly like the relationship i have with my isfj mother ! ! still , i wouldn't have any other type for a mom ; she grounds me like no other . oh yeah , i do that all the time ! that's sort of the fun part of the ne-te loop , because at least fi isn't completely left out . it judges yourself and decides that you need improvement . then ne comes ... i didn't mean rigidness as in spontaneous versus planned ... actually , i love planning things . in fact , planning / daydreaming about all the cool stuff we could do is at least half the fun of taking a ... the problem with the ne-te loop is that two extroverted functions are never supposed to , ideally , be working in tandem . it works well enough at my job , where i use ne to gather data , te to make ... good stuff , thanks for your thoughts ! my current job requires lots of te , with equal amounts of ne and si ( at different times , luckily ) , and almost no fi . i'm really stoked to be developing that ... that all sounds great in theory , but in actuality , i've just never developed an attraction to an intj because i don't find them very exciting . maybe if i met one that is really , really physically ... having pendulum-ed from one extreme ( my natural desire to seek greener grass ) to the other ( enduring a bad situation in misguided loyalty until i'm beaten and bruised ) , i've learned that what's ... so true ! when we're feeling positive , the world is our oyster and full of eternal possibilities . when we're feeling negative , especially stressed or scared , we somehow forget the undulating nature of ... agree 100 % with all you said , especially the red highlighted . on another note , i dated an istp for 2 years and it was one of the best relationships so far . we ended up breaking it off mainly ... totally agree , except i don't have any intj friends . my boss is one however , and though she's kinda cold sometimes , i feel like she's someone i can definitely learn from . i also feel i'm best ... as i'm in my mid - 20s , i'm going through some serious tertiary te development ... but i feel like lately it's been going a little overboard . i'm stuck in a ne-te loop ! this is what's been going on with ... in order of least attractive to most : i've never been attracted to an xstj ... not repulsed , just not attracted - - they aren't really crazy or fun enough to interest me . i have been repulsed , and ... i am entirely confused by this . dogs ? scullery boys ? cat wives ? what ? i never have a man in tow ... who wants to tow around a dude ? or anyone , for that matter . i need freedom and i want others to ... i need to own my anger more , and stop viewing it as wrong or bad . supposedly , it's actually a helpful emotion if you use it correctly ... which i haven't been . i tend to try and turn anger into ... i agree with the above ... when i read your evidence of aux fi , it struck me that all the descriptions were actually negative , as if you don't like fi and view it solely as a weakness . could that be ... i'm an event coordinator , with plans to someday have my own event planning and design business . i've been doing this sort of thing for about 3 years now and i love it ... i need a job with equal ... enfps are supposed to be very disorganized , or so says all the literature . and yet i love organizing things ( and i'm better at it than nearly everyone i know , including plenty of judgers . ) ... preach it girl ! ! ! ugh , this is such a freaking thorn in my side . i love guys as friends but it's very , very rare that they will be all for the totally platonic relationship that i ... it's seriously a thing . both of us do it like crazy . the infj i lived with was constantly judging me for it , so it's nice to have a roommate who won't give me passive aggressive looks if i make a ... this is more or less the experience i've had with infjs ... they makes excuses for their bad behavior but harshly judge bad behavior in anyone else . that said , the ones i've known were definitely not ... i love my estj friends dearly , but living with them would be a trainwreck . despite my strong te , my ne-fi lifestyle would annoy the shit out of them and they would end up hating me ;) i've been out of my parent's house for six years now , so i've got a decent amount of experience with roommates . very recently , i think i've come to discover the best mbti type for an enfp to have as ... same here . when you go to an art school , you tend to be designated the artsy one . also when you sew , do interior design for all your friends , throw theme parties , and have about a million d . i . y ...
