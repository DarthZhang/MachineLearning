' sure it is . which pill did you eat ? we choose to be brainwashed , because it's easier to deal with than trying to swim upstream . i don't think the ... you can't go through life with that mindset . it will drive you crazy . yeah , so um , here's a pretty cool arrangement of the song this thread references : the kids have some talent ... lol , go back and edit it ! i find myself editing posts over and over and over . i'm a basket case . : crazy : i don't think that parenthood comes 100 % naturally to anyone . that being said , you're still an enfj . it's just that we get more introspective as we get older . it's part of our ti , which is directly ... oh man , this is so true . i have a tendency to freak out at work over things that are beyond my control . and my entj co-worker is always busting my chops telling me that my biggest fault is that i ... i'm 3rd out of 4 , but my 2 older siblings are 11 and 9 years older than i am . my little brother is 3 years younger . i was a surprise , but my mom really wanted another after her conversion . they ... oh man , i think i could fill up the entire server if i posted everything i like . from jam bands like the grateful dead and phish to the beatles , to classical , to the doors , to hip-hip / r & b ( mostly ... if it helps to put 2.5 % into perspective , canada has 30 million people . 2.5 % is only 750,000 . toronto has roughly 2.5 million , which is 3.3 times that number . we're very rare . you're a freaking ... yeah , i'm with you on that note . i have way too much humility to have a big head . sometimes i really struggle with what a wonderful gift i've been given , and just hope to high heaven that i'm ... pretty much ... we trust people implicitly . we always see the good in people and focus more on their potential rather than how they might currently be . as a result we do have a propensity to being ... i love you . * hugs * hahahha ! i love that ! ! ! sometimes i'll just go to the produce section and hang out til the thunderstorm comes ! can someone please tell me what the hell is going on ? this is like my 5th sound of music reference this week . i swear god is telling me to watch it ... * big hug * sweetie , i love you . pics , dammit ! ! ! hahaha ! i actually like that test better . with the ' yes or no ' variety , sometimes my answer is ' neither ' and sometimes it's ' both . ' so it's basically flipping a coin . though i think there should only be 5 ... good thread . haha , i took that pic . though come to think of it , it's pretty much a standard pose for me too ... cool , thanks . ok , here's my eyes . this was taken last monday night at a houseboat party : that sucks ... not sure if it makes me an enfp , but this thread made me play salsa music and dance around my bedroom . lmao ! holy moly . i had absolutely zero intention of coming off as self righteous . quite honestly i shrink from the comparison . it's way too heavy for me to handle . ( i'm not religious at all . spiritual , ... how do you do it ? i've taken like 50 shots and they all look terrible . do you just crop a pic of your whole face or what ? mine are blue ... plus i'm all puffy from being out all night ... i get annoyed , but i understand that it's a two way street . i texted a coworker twice last night . no response . i was annoyed , and eventually got in touch with someone else . funny thing is , my ... * hugs everyone in the thread * i love you guys ! oh man , i had a nice response typed up , but it disappeared in a server time-out . doh ! lullabyblossom , have him take the test again . the results are notoriously inaccurate . my first time i tested ... thanks . that's pretty much what i was getting at . i'm exactly where i'm supposed to be . : happy : not a morning person at all , though its not like i wake up sullen or anything . i just prefer to gradually drift upward into consciousness , rather than be forced into it by an alarm . alarm clocks ... had a little moment today with the same chick i cried with on tuesday . neither of us broke down , since we were at work , but it was close , lol ... a couple nights ago , i got into it with someone at ... i had trouble finding my career . because my values are not the values of the world . i went to school for roughly five years , though not always full time . eventually , to me , it seemed stupid to go ... actions speak louder than words , my friend . where is this change we were supposed to believe in ? no offense , and if this is crossing far enough into politics as to be unacceptable , then i will delete it , but obama is absolutely not an enfj . bailing out the banksters from wall street on the backs ... i've been going through this recently . it's only been the last couple days when i've actually been able to be myself around her ... as for why it happens , i think it has to do with our innate desire ... agreed . in my work situation , co-workers will come to me with a gripe or whatever because i'm more in tune with their emotional needs and feelings . so i'll act as the mediator and go to the entj on ... <--- jealous . i want to hook up with the entj i work with . she's effin awesome . thanks . i'm sore all over . wow . i think my entire left side is one big bruise . i cried 3 times today . once when i saw my female enfj friend be wonderful to someone . it was so touching . next , when that same friend said something wonderful to me .
