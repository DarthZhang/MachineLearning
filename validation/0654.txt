a function is by definition an ... you're probably right there . and i relate a lot to disliking small talk and switching off when people are talking to me . i work in a customer service job and sometimes i don't know how i make it ... i think the problem is that ne works unconsciously . people always see ni as a ' mysterious ' function that no one seems to be able to describe properly , but it is often forgotten that ne is ... i don't think that was exactly the question i was asking - to be honest i'm not even sure what i was confused about now ! but i appreciate your answers . i understand the cognitive functions very ... my definitions of extraversion being objective and introversion being subjective are based on jung's descriptions , so perhaps this is where i have caused confusion . for example , this is part of ... i'm not sure if this is the sort of answer you are looking for , but the first thing that came into my head was eye-contact . istps seem to make much more eye-contact with me when speaking than intps ... your type : infp infp : - i have only recently met someone , for the first time ever , who i believe to be infp . i feel we would get on extremely well if we actually opened up to each other , but both ... sorry for my late response wien . this sounds right to me - i'm wondering if describing other similar functions would make it easier to undersand ni : si - using facts in their inner world ( use of ... this makes sense thanks . but i think the main thing that puzzles me is this : why are intjs / infjs generally more decisive than most other types ? does an intj ' explore ' their unconscious in the same ... i suppose what i meant was that a ' rational ' type will use their perceiving function for a reason ( because ' irrational ' literally means ' without reason ' ) . so when you say : - i assume that ... this was actually a reply to a thread moved from another section , so that was why i used the words as you said . i wondered where my post had gone ! i didn't have the chimp picture there either - so ... myers briggs - a simple explanation i - subjective ( using inner information ) e - objective ( using external information ) n - being ... i think what you are describing is a result of fi , so i guess all infps feel this way . in one description of introverted feeling , i like this part the most : i always feel motivated to do ... i bought beren's book after you mentioned her descriptions in that other thread , so thank you for that . but although i think beren's descriptions are clearer , i don't think myers misunderstood jung's ... actually i think we are optimistic and this causes us to be negative . with fi as our dominant function , we have values - ideals of how thinks should be , how we want them to be . so when things don't ... thank you . i think this is more or less what i was trying to say when talking about estjs . to judge the external world with te , they must have to use se / ne to perceive it at the same time . i ... i think i was just trying to explain my own way of seeing how people make decisions . ignoring all personality theories , i was simply saying that people cannot make a decision before perceiving ... i am aware of this , but i meant that i didn't understand how any type can use a judging function before a perceiving one . you said before : when you say that a judgement is ' already in ... could you ( or anyone else ) explain how other theories then , such as socionics or beren's types , use dichotomies differently ? i don't see how any other method could be used to create a theory . ... the problem is that we usually seem so calm and relaxed . so when we show people that we are actually capable of experiencing anger , they think that it's what we are hiding all the time . i live in a ... this is why it seems to me that myers has made a mistake . she seems to make expression and thought process the same thing , so that fi means to both get information from one's own mind , and also be ... i did read that a while ago actually . but despite my love of quoting things , i'm pretty bad at taking in information i read : tongue : . yes i should have known this . i always tend to focus too ... and these origins are pretty ancient . the words artisan ( sps ) , guardian ( sjs ) , idealist ( nfs ) and rational ( nts ) are translations of plato's types from 340 b . c . this was written by david keirsey : myers's e-i scale is badly flawed because she inherited jung's error of confusing extraversion with observation ( s ) and introversion with introspection ( n ) this has actually been really hard for me to work out . when i take tests that measure my preferred functions , fi and ni are always equally my dominant ones . it seems that it's only because my ne is ... i think keirsey's idea was that these pairings are the most ' useful ' to each other . for example , the entj can give clear direction to an infp's ' cause ' . i'd imagine ( and kind of hope ) that the ... david keirsey mentioned that we have different ' values ' . for ' seeking ' he said that : sjs seek security sps seek stimulation nfs seek identity nts seek knowledge and for ' yearning ' he said : ... actually i think the main problem is that it has been written by someone else . if it had been an autobiography ( as opposed to a biography ) , then you would have a good point about him being ... myers wrote in a preface to ' gifts differing ' that her mother ( briggs ) was infj , and that she used her introverted intuition as insight into the meaning of type . i don't know about jung , but isabel myers was infp and katharine briggs was infj ( according to myers herself ) i understand everything you've said apart from this : if you imagine someone without any intuition at all ( obviously no people like this exist , but just to help explain ) .
