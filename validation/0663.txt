' i was just being fussy about my a & p class that day . i hate anatomy and physiology ... its not where my hook is . i didn't think of that . thats perfect lol 59374 for me , in my relationship with an nf , it might sound odd but , they aren't really that hard to take care of emotionally . the golden rule is this : don't let a day go by when you haven't given them at ... i'd be pretty surprised if an intp took the time to brag . it is true at times they can think of themselves highly , but the chances of them getting past the insecurity to do so , as well as actually ... you make very valid points . i think it is a bit situational . if an intp gets into a situation where they are in control and doing precisely what they want , then x93hard workingx 94 and fun are one in the ... i agree overall . i think in someways its because we have more of it . plus society now days doesn't have as much value for us as it once did . i often feel this way intjs ... not necessarily . in fact infj's are very reluctant about doing so . they hate conflicts and only pursue them when they have too . they are more likely to champion someone to do it for them . i only disagree with thor as an estp . in fact i think he may very well be an esfp given that he is likewise emotionally driven . hulk ... i-not very sociable s-no intuition very impulsive f-raw and ... its a bit debatable . in the movie he seems more t like . in the books he is definitely f . his narrations often are things that are very topical of how an f would think . he talks about how sherlock ... my sister in-law is an isfj . i want to to solve mysteries with her like sherlock ( intp ) and watson ( isfj ) . exactly ! i've been calling this egocentric cognitive fallacy for some time now ( cause that sounds cool to me ) . you can learn a lot from people just by realizing that they believe that you think the ... no gods no masters here . entp sounds like you've had a rough ordeal . i'm pretty sure you'd hate me . i'm a t by 3 points out of 30 . logical and ethical perfectionist . i get lots of love and hate from both sides . really though i ... mmm ... what pisses off an intp ? thats easy ... an estp lol i much prefer life in my mind . the external would is too petty and rarely reverent . and yet i can't live without it . estp . as a psychology major this is actually what i study . i wouldn't be worried if you score high on the mach scale . i would be worried if you scored high on that and hare's checklist . and i'm ... i'm a big yankees fan and an intp . i also played in high school . mmm ... what pisses me of ... estps . odd ... i can't think of anything else right now . dude i was just thinking the same thing lol . there pretty rare though . t girls must have really hot personalities . ice cold and challenging . they are also insulting and have an answer for everything especially when they are being exposed for who they are . overall i do and don't agree . we have to remember personalities aren't as black ... my complaint exactly ... sherlock is awesome ! the nt for sure . the i would be hard to argue . the j / p would be a little harder . when affirmation isn't legitimate and is poorly covered up to the point that to us its obvious and insulting to our intuition . its in the book ' the sociopath next door ' when in the back of your mind your fretting about having the time to do that thing you don't wan to do so much that you actually think and feel the time is closer then it really is but only for a ... intp porn ... i've never considered being gay for stephen hawking till just now ... and i'm not even gay ... an estp i once new used to tell me his life philosophy was no regrets . i think he was a bit different though because he channeled his boredom very distinctively and hurts a lot of people ... if i recall correctly , they where noted for being egocentric and when the men would go hunting they would stay behind and manipulate and seduce the women even if they already had a mate . technically there are other situations involving stupidity that you can't change . like apathy . sometimes people have there personalities wired to be stupid . although the eskimos did have a word for ... yeah that's true . the part i don't agree with is the 6 hours . sure we do need social time especially to fulfill the extroverted intuition function . but we need days off too . every day 6 hour a day i ... you realized you've over socialized and you need three days in the nest alone . thats because there not introvert and they are suffering from an egocentric fallacy . well in a maslow / rogers respect , acceptance of others is a feature of self-actualization . i think acceptance of self is something intps sometimes need to work on more . to much stuff that i have to do that i don't feel like doing ... my oh i'm just interested in porn thats all lol i'm pretty sure i want to divorce my wife and its partly because i know she can't keep up with me intellectually but its also because shes a protectionist and i'm tired of tolerating it .  ... some yatta yatta about staying in school comes to mind ... your gonna hate those real jobs and the only way around it is education . practice find a joke the works for you and use it . start ... aspd ( antisocial personality disorder ) on so gullible i just can't help but believe in everything you say ! marry me and break my heart for a life time ! hot dogs , french fries and love . you can't really clean your room cause you keep playing with all the stuff you just found . i totally relate to that . its really bad when i start thinking of funny stuff and then i'll laugh and no one knows why lol ironically it seems funny in its self . yeah tell me about it . makes me feel like i'm spinning too much sometimes . ever try not to be and intp ? ... ... hold that thought ... ... see ya can't do it now can you ! ? lol bravo thanks for sharing ! life isn't so black and white . sometimes ... in fact rather frequently , its best to conclude that it is best not to conclude . i've wondered a lot about this and part of me thinks there might just be something to the connection of physiology and personality . i first thought about this with the glaring similarities of people ...
