' i haven't had any children yet , but i'm young . as the oldest of a large family led by a single mother , i have already been the co-parent for years . most of the women in my family have been tied down ... i know that i'm nodding , and smiling , but please stop telling me every inane detail of your life . i'm polite , not actually interested . in general , do you prefer texting or phone calls ?

the issue is that i'm not sure how possible it is to keep the acquaintance minimal . we talked nonstop before , ( texting , calling , ect . ) , and he's pushed the amount of contact we have back up to that , ... he's said as much , in the past . he's also said that he simply really didn't want to be a cliche . he's a wildly good guy . a little misguided once in awhile , but essentially a wonderful person . my ... alright , this is going to be a doozy . i'd love responses from true intjs , or people who at least know them intimately . i'm an infj female . years ago , i met an intj male . we clicked immediately , ... i'm going to go with a combination of the two above answers . when i lock eyes with someone , it generally means that i like them enough to give them the effort , i'm genuinely trying to suss out what ... ugh , this . i generally don't invite people over , even those that i generally like . if i invite you to my home , the most holy of holies , i am going to act exactly like myself there , or end up totally ... oh man , my eating habits are a nightmare . i frequently forget to eat . i generally forget at least one meal a day . i'm totally addicted to caffeine , and without it , i just cannot get moving . when i ... as an infj , i've read nearly every page on the internet about infjs , or so i would like to believe . nearly every single one of them mentions something about us being creative . now , don't ... i imagine that i'm difficult to be in a relationship with , but it's working out so far . i agree with almost everything that's been said so far . i want to know everything there is to know about my ... i agree with a lot that's already been said . i absolutely need someone who i feel supports and accepts me . i feel as though i am censoring myself nearly 95 % of the time , and when i can find someone ... i do this , but it's not normally just waiting for my thoughts to develop ; that happens quickly . it's more like ... waiting for an opportune moment that doesn't break the flow of conversation , and by ... i , personally , hate sleeping . it feels like a gigantic waste of time to me . i truly , truly wish i could enjoy sleeping , because i am literally exhausted all the time . someone teach me ! this . it drives my istp up the wall . what do you mean by that ? i mean literally nothing besides what i said . are you sure ? ... i don't know if know if this is totally strange , but i never hear of other people doing it ; all of my cd mixes are centered around a mood instead of a singular artist or album . i literally have an ... i've seen a couple of people mention the news , and that seems to be a huge trigger for these sorts of dark days for me . i've been told to simply avoiding reading the news , but that answer is ... i'm not sure if this is actually an infj thing , or just a me thing , but i have days that i simply refer to as dark days . it seems as though everything is wrong with the world , and that it really ... my soon to be husband is an istp . we've been together for years and years , but it's interesting how understood i felt . i've totally opened up to him in a way that i haven't been able to with anyone ... how would you define boundary setting ? can you give us a real-life example ? this . i'll regularly sleep four hours a night so that i can have more time awake and alone , and then i crash . does anyone know of any other types that have the sort of self-imposed moral struggles that infjs seem to impose on themselves ? i thought you said that he was online and doing other things . i'm sorry , but this sounds like an excuse . especially since he read your message and simply didn't respond . perhaps he was hoping your ... plenty of acquaintances who would probably consider me a friend , but who i feel know literally nothing about me , but maybe two people i would consider a friend . i'm usually pretty good about this , but when left to my own devices completely , i'll sometimes realize i haven't showered in a few days . leaving the house is normally my trigger to remember to do ... goodness , this is me to a tee . it really bothers my istp . someone will buy me something , and i won't get rid of it , ( because it would be rude ) , but i also won't ever wear it or use it because it's ... this . i don't think she was unhealthy . people have sex , that's fine . i just don't see an infj getting that intimate , that fast . this was from the same page as what i originally posted , so it may not apply to you . of all types , infjs ( and intjs ) are the most detached and disconnected from their own bodies . not only is ... yep . we're having a wedding at the top of a mountain , alone , with just our witnesses and our officiant . we wrote the ceremony , ect . the wedding part doesn't really appeal to me , but the marriage does . it's my istps favorite movie , and he insisted i had to watch it . i think it's the poetic justice thing . this , in particular ; i don't think i'm the ... i've read that a lot of infjs stuggle with body awareness , which is why i also eat like an 8 year old . i can't stand the taste of alcohol . and i agree , i don't mean fine things like a label , just ... the marriage thing i understood . i'm getting married in 6 weeks , but once in awhile i feel like marriage , registering your commitment with the state , is a little trite . i like to imagine that i ... 148258 i do this too , exactly ! i'll make a calendar , and lists , and research how to properly complete the task ... :d ry : i'll suddenly realize that the dishes need to be done , or the cat needs to be fed ... i bolded the ones that i've seen , and i've loved all of them . apparently i need to see the rest of the list ! i'm convinced we're the same person . i'll generally pick a book that i've been meaning to read , something popular but not too out there . i was actually thinking the same thing from some of your other posts ! gifts are really , really difficult for me too . even small things . when i was a child and i'd be spending time with a friend , ... this ! i actually think that's my personal way of balancing my guilt at feeling materialistic , with my love for pretty things . for example , i would rather have one pair of louboutins than than one ... i just found an article that describes infj se in a way that absolutely and completely fits me . what do you think ? despite being the most otherworldly and abstract of the types , infjs have a ... this one works . lying people make my blood boil , but i'm also terribly anti-conflict unless someone is being directly harmed . if you can find a way to reconcile these two , let me know ! interested in where this ... my mom's an esfp . we get along great because she realizes that she doesn't quite understand me , and that's okay . she tries her best , and she's one of the kindest people i've ever met . she would do ...
