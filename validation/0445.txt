herculean effort required to pay attention . especially in large groups where other extroverts may be guiding the conversation . my patience ... my day has been spent attempting to understand and describe the love i find myself falling deeper and deeper into . it started 10 days ago with a 4 + hour conversation into the wee hours of the ... absolutely 100 % . i have always loved music , and this is at least part of the reason why ! working with music so often now though , i often meditate separately in order to sort through what an enfp ... hearts don't need to have genders :) man , i know exactly how you feel . that struggle definitely defines a solid part of my existence . i am sx / so , definitely attracted to so / sx . dead simple and obvious to me . i do certainly utilize the heck out of <so> to search for love , but how else would you go about it ? : - remember also that some people are looking for different things in relationships . maybe an entp isn't what you're looking for . the ideal personality match for me as an enfp is supposedly an intj but ... i am the same way . debate doesn't count as conflict to me though . that is something entered into by people with a mutual understanding of what's expected of them behaviorally . depends who from ! anyone bubbly , warm or sincere ( any of these is fine ) then absolutely ! that's the caveat i would say , if you're trying to put yourself out of your own comfort zone to give a hug , ... other nf's can be pretty feedback loopy for me , i like them best as friends , maybe very good friends , but an so ? that's never been what i look for in a relationship ... too much overlap of wavelength ... oh you meant the tv guy ... i thought you meant the barbarian and was immediately confused . pretty sure he is an sp . toristar just tell us you're lost . that doesn't bother us , we hear it all the time . if you ask for clarification on something , we'd be thrilled to tell you about it ! really , our rants for ... this is a love language kind of thing . if you explain all that theory to the intj about the different projective / receptive ways that love is received and interpreted by different people , they should ... yeah what regho said . probably the easiest way to determine one way or the other . my mom is enfj and freaks out ( or is at least very seriously concerned ) about scheduley things all the time . me , i ... physically ? fit asian women small noses expressive mouths long tongues the colour orange 3 specific hairstyles that have nothing in common with each other , and therefore confuse me . sharp ... haha oh man ... i have responded to three proclamations of love just like this . what else do you do ? afterwards i always have to have a long philosophical discussion about my issue with those words ... i agree with sai , sometimes enfp desires to use other people's reactions to judge ourselves can be detrimental , especially if we're hanging out with people who don't completely jive with our own ... thanks for all of this . the thing is , he doesn't consider himself depressed , because his philosophy is in line with his current emotional state : ' nothing matters ... nothing exciting in life ... pillow he hasn't taken ex in years . he drinks occasionally with friends about once a month , but other than that he isn't on any kind of medication or drugs . he isn't exactly a negative person , and ... i am writing this on behalf of my good friend who is an intj and came to me asking if i could think of any possible solutions for him . he reports feeling total numbness , apathy and disinterest in ... yesterday i was convinced i was composed entirely of animated mushroom chicken potato tomato alfredo noodles , and i was trapped under an upside down bowl ( actually the blanket on my bed ) against a ... huh , interesting . i get the same way about any of that awkward kind of relationship humour where one of the characters acts against their own character in a futile attempt to please the other person ... anything well written with good editing . those are the most important things . generally speaking , the less fantastical everything occurring is , the better the writing itself needs to be to hold my ... yeah , that used to work for me , but now i am usually too good at avoiding stress to be able to employ it as a motivator :P for me personally , sex is a natural extension of intimacy , so if it wasn't happening that frequently with someone i was going out with , i would feel a lack of closeness in general . if you can't ... haha istp's going to mess everyone up . i am truly happy in the arms of a loved one . i am truly happy when i am dancing , my body representing the music in it's own language . with an ear for nothing but the music in my blood and not a ... hm . i have alot of introverted friends , and it's really easy to be around them . we form a nice balance . being around other extroverts can be really fun , but if you're very different people , then ... i realized early on that my success in formal education was often determined by my interest level . this was more and more noticeable as i got older . i mitigated the issue at the post-secondary level ... yes , a man and a woman can just be friends , though there is often some wrestling with varying levels of attraction at some point in time . yes , i have talked about this with my friends , and they think one of the reasons i'm so attractive in social situations is the fact that i can talk about so many things , including other people , with ... kuromi no , i mean exactly what coccinellidae is talking about as well , but i don't feel it is a conscious decision . when someone points out another person's interest to me , i am both surprised and ... them : you know you're completely crazy / insane / out-of-your-fucking-mind right ?
