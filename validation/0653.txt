' the ni is strong in our family xd it's funny because my family has kind of always been known for our eyes , and how we all stare / zone out in the same way hahaha it cracks me up , people are basically ... yes , i agree . it definitely does make sense ( and seems to be ) that it would be spatial vs logical , i've just hoped to find a pattern in cognitive functions that would point one way or another . but ... i think we'll definitely have more intuitive data points ... : tongue : talked to an istp and estp irl today and both of them said the same . yeah ! ! hurray for another sensor vote ! lol , i love you . and i was totally the same way . or just too head in the clouds to follow the whole thing : laughing : see , i never liked the word or story problems ! but solving for x , step by step , so satisfying : kitteh : lol so far we have a bunch of intuitives preferring algebra and one lone sensor preferring geometry ! interesting ! need more >:) whether you love math or not , it seems most people have a clear preference for either algebra or geometry . i'm interested in seeing if there is any kind of cognitive function pattern that we can ... and you won't see it again because you don't look at your subscribed threads : ninja : yeah , it's strange to me as well , because it's not like a trail of cheerios being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner where if the vacuum is going over the trail , it doesn't matter how fast or slow it ... owner of a lonely heart , for quite a while i thought my mom had to be esfp but had a hard time settling on it . this video helped me a lot , particularly his explanation of esfps ' tendency to not just ... adk , i just learned about it recently and it has blown my mind ! you asking about awareness made me think of it . :) do you know about the observer effect ? i think that sounds about right for inferior se ? inferior with se : i see you , hi , * cracks a joke that makes person smile / blush / laugh / side-eye * inferior with ne : oh hi , i didn't see you ! * cracks joke about whatever theory they were lost in ... this is gonna sound weird but rock climbing was going to be an example i gave but decided to not give an example to just see how you guys would answer it ! : shocked : dyslexicon and i talked about all these typings last night and i attempted to explain an inferior fe ( inferior ) difference i feel when paired with ne vs paired with se but he laughed at me so i don't ... oh : unsure : i posted the istp / intp videos instead xd i guess a question for stopwatch ( and you ) would be what excites you ? what do you like thinking about ? are you aware of problems you enjoy ... you are clearly skeptical to my skrepticism ! hahahahahahahaaa * finger * yeah an because the 9 will make it more intuition and gut and stuff so i haven't read everything but dyslexicon and i have been siscussing this ; and we both agree that owner could very much be e because 9 and pe dom with 9 will look differnt than typical extrovert ... agreed . he has a pretty amazing understanding and handle of the cognitive functions , how they are exhibited and interact with one another , and jungian theories in general . yes , and your active brainstorming could be ne . i guess it's just the very external sense-centric brainstorming that leads me to think se over ne , but ne wouldn't be surprising at all , either . i think it was dizzy that referred to you seeming possibly strong in intuition , which i can see in that you seem to have an active and vivid imagination . i guess i'm thinking of actually talking to ... i think that could very likely be explained by being enneagram 9 , though ? i guess where i'm coming from is the aspect of your typing that i personally feel most certain about is you being fi / te ... can you explain why it is you think you're ti-dom ? lol xd his monotone at first was a bit distracting for me , but after sticking with him a bit more , i grew to actually love his voice ! to the point that i sometimes listen to his videos while i drive ... owner of a lonely heart i feel the xsfp typing fits you well , and thought that isfp typing was very possible but when thinking of how i would type you , i would lean esfp . i had planned on writing ... stopwatch , dizzy showed me this guy's youtube channel a while ago and i lovvve him . i'd suggest maybe watching these videos and seeing what you think ? ... so stopwatch i don't want to be redundant and repeat a lot of what people have already said ( i agree with much of what has been said ) so i'll say what's on my mind right now . i have assumed you ... stopwatch yay ! i'm on my phone until tomorrow but will respond then ! :) well i fail too or i'm just extremely narcissistic because i didn't even notice that you hadn't quoted me : laughing : : unsure : disqus confuses me : unsure : i know what episode you're from ... dr . jacobyyy you're herrre ! ! ! cue 5c hi . what am i helping with ? : unsure : yesss ! <3 dyslexicon is staying with me this summer , you should stow away in his suitcase >:) : laughing : oh wow . there are meds that really help that , right ? ? pretty good ! not a whole lot of tcing going on these days , but there should be a renaissance ! how are you ? ? it was at the top of my subscribed list and you were the last to post so i clicked : kitteh : hi ! oh ! i just looked it up , she is lebanese-british ! so yeah , i totally think it's we'll see you at the afterparty or we'll see you at the afterparty i think there's a the before the off sound . if it weren't george clooney's wife at an awards show , i'd think she was saying we'll see you in the office haha is she british ? she could be ... oh , pretty good , how about you ? ? we should plan a tc reunion , i miss your face ! hi ! yeah , i kinda recently reached 1000 . it's actually surprising to me that i've posted that many times outside of the mafia forum , lol wow ! :D '
