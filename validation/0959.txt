( does it count as necroposting if the thread never really started ? ) anyway , i love homestuck ! don't worry about it ! of course you couldn't be expected to know what i didn't tell you . thanks for the hug ! ! ! ^ ^ i think i just need to give it some time and try talking things out with him a ... well i'm catholic so i actually do believe that we weren't meant for this world lol ... but honestly , that's pretty much how i feel most of the time anyway . i'm okay with that . this world isn't ... welcome ! :) lemondropg thanks for your response ! a lot of what you've said is right on , but i really didn't elaborate very much and it's actually a pretty long story hahaha ... i'm not entirely sure what ... welcome ! i hope you enjoy your time here . :) i'll give you some of my breast matter ! ! ! lol but seriously i have big boobs , and i don't exactly mind how they look i guess , but they are just so inconvenient ... always in the way . also they can ... i'm tired ... i took a 5 - ish hour long nap yesterday after work , and then i stayed up until 4 am and got up for work at 7 . : s had some pretty freaky dreams too . D: usually i'll actually shut myself up in my room and spend time alone until i feel comfortable with myself again , strange as that may sound . i'll just read , lie on my bed and listen to music , screw ... welcome ! i hope you find what you're looking for ... yeah i was starting to wonder where you had disappeared to ... i moved states when i was in middle school , and my old best friend and i still keep in touch regularly . i was just texting her last night , in fact . and i agree about long-distance dating ! i think i ... all very true ! oops , sorry if it sounded like i was suggesting that ! D: haha yeah that's why i'm considering just kicking his foot until he removes it and then slamming the door ! : o you're not alone ! i feel the same . i guess i'm the one who first mentioned alcohol on here , but i just like the taste of certain wines . i've actually never been drunk in my life lol . oh cool ! i will have to check this out more when i have some time . ^ ^ [ / font ] yesss ... [ / font ] hmm ... perhaps . i think my intercom is old and not actually very functional though ... ew beer is yucky ! ! ! dx i have not , though i've seen them around and i used to play halo back in the day ... maybe i'll have to check them out sometime ! probably would taste like dust , ew . but if it smelled like books ... i can't help but feel sorry for extroverts hahaha ... i don't necessarily mean romantic relationships , more like friends and family in my case . i've noticed over the past few years that i often prefer to love people from a distance . i think this is ... fantasy / sci-fi are your best bet , but you can't go wrong with the classics ... book flavored wine would be too overwhelming ! i think i'd probably just expire from the awesomeness of literally ... i could maybe use some advice ... i used to be absolute best friends with an isfj , but then for various reasons he cut off all of his friends and stopped talking to almost everyone . now , over a year ... books should do it ... or cheap wine . :P i think i'm going through the process of becoming un-nabbed ( by an isfj ) . : o when a saturday night is a big deal , because it means you get to stay in your room for hours and read . ^ ^ yeah i don't get it so much anymore ... more back when i was in middle school and early high school , because i didn't smile very much back then . now i usually only hear it when i'm spacing out and ... i really like intps , and my best friend at college is one , but one of my few complaints would be that she can be quite awkwardly blunt about some things . i'll go out of my way to avoid unnecessary ... last night my best friend was over , and she played with my hair while i lay there and rambled about feeling conflicted over something . then we started talking about friends and i told her how i'm ... idk about others but these ones drive me crazy : you're reading way too much into it . i'm sure that's not how they actually feel . you should come hang out with us more . i'm sure ... yes , i have , but i don't really think i can explain it ... yeah i get the whole instant trust thing as well . sometimes i like it , sometimes i don't lol . strangely , i think i also give off a bit of a cold , unapproachable vibe to people who don't already know ... my tritype is 9w1 5w4 4w5 welcome ! that milkshake sounds like heaven . now i'm starving ...
