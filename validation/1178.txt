that's my drug of choice . oh but we would ! but only to prove a point ;D hahaha that is so true ! lmfao see i totally agree with you there i don't really think any disorder exists . i got quality time 33 % words of affirmation 30 % physical touch 27 % acts of service 10 % receiving gifts 0 % guess i just don't care much for those gifts . i do feel maybe acts of service should ... that's just awkward , but it could be funny lol . i guess i wouldn't get pissed if a girlfriend did that to me , but i would kinda be like wtf ? ! ? ! ? what i love is when that's done to me xd just call me one eyed cut belly ! arrgghhh ! i've never met a fellow enfp guy , but i've met a few gals . xd epic enfp gathering ! hahaha no problem . and i understand your frustration about intutives trying trying to just guess the personality type of some other than just getting them to take the test , but it's not exactly that easy ... that's the one issue with some people sometimes epically enfp enneagram type fours such as myself . we tend to move on a bit better than most other enfp's , and we move on pretty harshly . espically ... that sounds freaking awesome . i'm a memeber of that group on facebook , but never really read anything that they posted . maybe if i ever go on my tour of the country like i plan to after i graduate ... read the tread a bit and you might find an answer to your question . hm maybe you need to make a crazy face or something ? :p :D sweet xd you look huggable too :D alpharetta ... is that southern georgia ? i'm gonna have to agree with both of you to some extent xd i definatly have to agree with that . i've actually never really been attracted to people unlike myself ... i actually wish i could find myself in another person more than anything . i don't want ... ah i totally agree , but sometimes you just gotta go crazy ! xd haha see that may not work but it still sounds like you get along great . lol well then you just have got to get lucky . plus those types of pictures are fun xd yeah i have some friends that are enfp that value truth , and loyalty , and the same types of things that i value , and we get along great . i actually think two enfp's are a great match . they can really ... ah cool somebody else on here my age :D i'm slightly younger though ... what do you mean can't handle it ? too busy ? i think that's where the difference comes in . enfp's dont even care that much about going all the way , because foreplay is just so fun ! xd ah dang that sucks . i don't actually have a webcam either . i used my sony handycam haha xd yeah i know what you mean . i hate it when somebody fights your fun like they just want you to be calm , and quiet isxj thing how old are you ? hm , your views are very very ... i'm not sure if i can find an appropriate word for it ... i keep thinking of the word free ... you seem to be a very free thinker . your views are unaffected by the social ... hah thanks :D that boosts my confidence : crazy : so i see you're relatively new here . where's your video ? ;) ah i love that feeling too :D but for a girl of course :p i was just getting sad the other night , because i haven't felt like that in a long time ... right there with you , except i'm still in highschool . with that said ... i will probably never put my body through that haha . i would never try shrooms . sounds kinda scary o . o i've heard lots of bad stories about aht ah gah don't do herione : confused : i think i get it now , and i must agree with you . that wouldn't make me feel good ! quite the opposite . hah i will :) he was just going on and on about how great this new medication was that he started on today is . he said guys i've never felt this good before i don't know why i find it so ... you know this doesn't usually happen to me on here , but i can actually say you went over my head with that one ... :/ ah sweet ! an enfp with bipolar ! ... hm sorry if that sounded a bit odd , but my best friend has bipolar , and i think it's freakin awesome ! he says it's the worst thing in the world , ( and i can tell ... i'm with you on keeping away from drugs . that was a bad part of my life really . and i agree wtiht he philosophical / religious convictions . oh and caffeine sucks i seem to be a bit jealous of this . i've delt with death , but it's never bothered me , because i've never actually acknowledged it . i guess it would really make me feel horrible to think about death , because there's no taking it back , ... i reworded the part at the end a bit . oh no i'm not still willing to accept her now . i'm very much done with this girl . she's not evil by any means , but her morals are very much not enfp-like ... haha it never really effected much , but my perception , which is why i liked it . i would never do it again now though . the only way i might would be if it was made legal . guys i have an update on this please check this out : recently i posted a thread in the estp forums about a girl that i dated that i believed to be my worst match . ( seen here : ) well i ... well back when i used to deal with such things i would say marijuana by far . '
