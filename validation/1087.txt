yeah , i'd get bored of the role pretty quickly . choatic neutral is probably more up an entp's alley . that said , the joker made a pretty good villain . some men just want to ... enfp because your signature is colorful . extrovert here . child of an istj mom . she basically trained me from an early age to seek stimuli from my environment , not from her . she was there for me , of course , but i needed to keep myself ... alright , i'm gonna try to hide my text . the ocean is vast and unpredictable . it's almost like the universe in that it's very difficult to fathom just how large it is . even if you're speaking at ... you guessed it ! and you've presented the perfect opportunity for the use of my signature . * bows * oh hell yes . it's my newest obsession . also , hook is pretty . you like the show too ? that's where all the cool people congregate . but in all seriousness , yeah , i just checked and folks are in antarctica and nowhere else . bizarre . thank you everybody for your advice and comments . i'm glad to say that i didn't freak out on my nephew , despite how inwardly disturbed i felt . i wasn't able to act in the moment , but i feel i'll be ... so my nephew is 10 years old and today , my mother ( his grandmother ) and i ran into a really super awkward situation with him . i'm hoping for some advice or insight , any help really . as his aunt , ... it was an xntj teacher . i don't know what it was about him , but he seemed more like a character from a story than a person . so many introverted nfs are at home or else in quiet places like libraries or something ... careful , guys . as you can see , if make yourselves too scarce , the entps will start sending out search ... i was terrible at math once i hit high school . i had to work very , very hard at it in college . got myself a tutor , studied for hours every day . the only way i got through it was learning the steps ... emma : istp mary margaret / snow white : ixfp , though she sometimes gives off fe vibes , so i dunno . david nolan / prince charming : isfj regina : enfj henry : enfp mr . gold : tough call . seems to ... i have this same need to always find precisely the right word . i get extremely frustrated when the word evades me and i have to settle for something else while talking . i feel so lame when that ... i like rpgs , adventure and puzzle games . i'm a big fan of bethesda and bioware . oh my . i'm quite flattered . thanks for thinking of me , you sexy infj you . it's an intriguing combination . : wink : have you been hanging out at the entp board at all ? you'd be shown some love , i'm quite sure . : tongue : i guess extraverts aren't wanted in this thread ... but , mmm , infjs ... mostly i see a combination of female infj / male entp interest on the entp forum . which is depressing for female entps . at ... i look younger . at my last job , my co-workers all thought i was 16 . i'm 23 . it's cool , i guess , but i've noticed a downside in relation to dating . i only ever seem to get hit on by dudes younger than ... here's one way to look at it . you've got two people at a party being wallflowers . one wants to be on the sidelines , quietly observing , while the other desperately wants to be a part of the action but ... good point . does everybody here know their parents ' types ? my dad is an esfj and my mom is an istj . my mom was the more pro-homeschooling parent . i was homeschooled for a few years in high school . i attended public elementary and junior high school , though . i'm an entp . introvert . someone mentioned spike from buffy . yep , i had a huge crush on him back in the day . also , nathan fillion in the firefly days . lately : chris hemsworth and tom hiddleston . so i should probably just ... istp , i'd say . singer , actress , artist , archaeologist , astronaut , author , actress again , game designer , author again , psychiatrist ... at the moment i'm unemployed , and i don't know what i want to do . acting and ... i had a similar experience and i've had similar regrets . i can't offer advice . at least nothing you probably haven't considered yourself . i do think the advice you've heard ( don't live in the ... isfp , i say . entp , because of the signature and the avatar . entp here so i can't give advice on intps ... but we're similar , right ? i dated an infj and there was some mutual annoyance in this area , i think , based on a ne vs ni thingy going on . basically , ne ... you seem like an istp . i read through this thread and i'm seeing a lot of people typing you as estp . i can see it to some degree , but the more i see of you , the less convinced i am that you possess a strong ti . you're more ... estp ? basing this off some wacky imaginary intuitive vibes ! ( too lazy to check post history . ) infj , perhaps . you'd need to pay for an assessment if you wanted a very thorough test , but even those tend to rely on forced choice questions . like i said , the tests are flawed . they will tend to vary based on ... ' kay . the tests are unreliable . forced choice quizzes say you are one thing or the other . there is no in between , there is no scale . the tests are great for introducing the concepts , but if ... ... i really don't think you're an entp . i'm sensing that you'd really like to be one , though . whatever floats your boat . but if what you're wanting is external validation for that particular typing , ... i'm seeing very little evidence of fe or ti . you don't really strike me as an enfp . maybe a fi dom ? he might be idealistic , but at least as far as the movies are concerned , what really drove him to accept the title of captain america ? a sense of duty . i see a combination of si and fe , but i'm not ... f vs t is not about feeling or not feeling . we all feel and we all think . i think you know that , i'm just saying . a thinker type feels everything that a feeler does . we tend to put less emphasis ... well , that's one of the ways you differentiate between a shy extrovert and an introvert . they're both sitting on the sidelines , but one of them wants to be there while the other is dying to be ... well , when discussing something with someone , it's best to be certain that you have the same idea on what that thing means . definitions vary more widely than you might guess . but what i was trying ... i'm well aware of the difference . what is your definition of a shy person ? i've actually found the opposite to be true . the shy introverts are often perceived as reserved , but secretly quite intelligent . it's a generalization to say that this is always true ( it isn't ) but ... yeah ... i'm gonna vote in this poll . as a girl . take that ! so yeah , i'm here about fi . i've decided to bug the infps rather than the isfps , just because we share ne and i'm hoping that will make it easier . i've done a lot of research and i think i ...
