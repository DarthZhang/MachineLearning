' i'm infj and i'd honestly like to know what the best type for me is . we're obviously so freaking hard to date ... i suspect maybe another j type but not sure . that may be a personal preference . i think nfs make better advisors ... there's a chance that if you reach out to her , call her or something , and let her know you've been thinking about her , she'll realize you're not upset with her for ignoring you and may talk to you ... i do that all the time ... even though i'm very socially capable , if i become too overloaded with the stresses of life and / or relationships with people around me , i tend to withdraw to regroup . it ... my advice is to deal with her in a way that she understands . you're an infj , which means you can more easily emulate other types anyway . be an aggressive extrovert long enough to put your foot down ...  met an estp and love his personality . i was wondering if anyone had any experiences in an estp / infj relationship ? dore i agree with all that wholeheartedly . and i really had to learn how to spend my energy wisely . i have a tendency to expend it all in big bursts and then become useless socially , lol . paladinx i'm curious too ... well , there may be a reason you so closely relate , because 100 % of that article applies to me . good stuff and bad . do you know where you fall on the s / n spectrum ? you may be close to the middle , ... i think you may have missed a point or two ... we don't make ourselves this way , it's in our nature . but thank you for the kind spending my life alone advice . i certainly don't hate being infj . i know that we're gifted in ways . it's just that we are rare , and so are our gifts and so it's so hard for many people to understand them , and us . and not to ... would have to be either ravenclaw or gryffindor , depending on how extroverted i were feeling at the time ... :) i'd like to hear some feedback from people interested in this article ! i found it incredibly exposing actually . it takes some people years to know this much about me ... but here you go , all you ... anyone who is even considering being in a long term relationship with an infj : please for the love of god read this first this article describes the infj the way they just cannot explain ... haha ! : laughing : you're such a smart ass , i love it . better than being a dumb ass . or just an ass if you want to abbreviate that too ... my advice : don't overdo the messages . that would probably maker her withdraw even more , because you will look clingy and desperate . once she loses respect , you've lost your chance . that's true ... yeah , sure . an infj by any other name ... lol . just don't call me late for dinner ... :) also , perceivers are known for not doing much planning at all ... lol . so take it with a grain of salt , and be true to who you are , happy with what you have , and also happy with some of the things you ... well to elaborate on what i said before , i do think you should consider your future , and know yourself well enough to establish some goals . but there is a fine line sometimes between planning for ... but the few friends i do have love me for my honesty , some say they even need me for it . i understand because i need them for the same reason you know ? and those sincere people will be in my life ... but the few friends i do have love me for my honesty , some say they even need me for it . i understand because i need them for the same reason you know ? and those sincere people will be in my life ... i know right ? this is why it's so hard to find a decent relationship ( of any kind really ) ! i sit around and think a lot about how oh there are so few real men left but it's true for women too . ... yeah , sorry just trying to shorthand cause i was being lazy . if you want , you can call me o ! :) that's because people generally do run away after the barrier is cracked , and they can see all of our extremely deep , totally abstract processes , thoughts , and opinions . it just looks weird and ... exactly . i can socialize up a storm , but i've had to suddenly excuse myself a few times to take a mini mental-vacation in the bathroom or run around the block to clear my head . when they ask where ... be careful of that . it could keep you from being able to be happy with , and appreciate , what you have . you'll always be thinking what if . i find it helpful to talk to a xxtj when i need to ... yes , me too . and i'm pretty blunt for an nf type it seems . is it the judging function that causes that ? all i know is , being totally straight with people has done me , and them , way more good than ... i'll bet if you could find a entj that you share the same basic principles with , you'd be great friends . my entj buddy is extremely loyal , honest , and makes me feel strong and encouraged . they're ... yes , dm , i definitely agree . like i said , you can lead a horse to water , blah , blah , blah . ( but you can't make him drink ) but really , my true belief is that all you can do is teach someone ... sometimes i feel like i will never meet a partner that will be able to understand me on every level . i love my friends , and they love me . but i've never met another infj . the closest i've come is ... you make some good points , and you're right jungledisco , it is a self preservation act , but it's also an attempt to preserve others ' feelings from being needlessly hurt . and i know what you're ... jungledisco - well , i was referring more to how i have this natural way of making people comfortable around me . i'm very laid back and easy to get along with , and genuinely interested in people . ... maybe it's a good thing then to have this kind of balance ? although i'm not sure sometimes whether to go or stay , lol . i love people , and i'm great in a social situation for a while , but once i'm ... oh , wow . that sounds a lot like me . and i feel like most people find my enthusiastic friendly attitude exhausting most of the time . the thought of that's depressing b / c i feel like i have to ... and i'm the most extraverted introvert possible . quite literally . i don't need nearly as much alone time as many do , as long as i pace myself socially . i'm interested in what this is like for other people , especially other infjs . infj is the most extroverted of the introverts anyway , and i'm only 1 % introvert . so , i feel like i'm the most ... snowleopard - hey i'm not allowed to reply to messages apparently yet ... i have to post more first so let me go make some posts i guess so i can help you out , lol . also , opeth rocks . m / my ex was a lot more introverted than me , and he needed at least a couple hours a day totally alone apparently . so it's hard to say . it really depends on the person , and where they fall on that i / e spectrum . i'm almost smack in the middle , so i'm only 1 % introverted ... i'm usually fine in social situations , and generally only ... what exactly is it that you're asking ? can you elaborate ? i agree , but i wonder if it is possible ( through example only of course ) to teach someone love , if they are inclined toward a similar style of love as me ? like perhaps another nf type ? otherwise i ... enfj's are sooo awesome too ... i'm infj if anyone has any questions . i'll answer the best i can , based on my own perspective ! oh ! i love being happy ! i'm infj and new here too . hi ! i don't get it either , dude . i think it's kind of selfish to those that love you , if that's not being way too blunt ( sorry if it is , sincerely ) . and i'm sorry that your friend did that to you and ... i hate that most people insist that i'm an extrovert . i'm just really good at socializing . that doesn't mean i like to do it all the time ! infj is the most extroverted of the introverts , but since ... sometimes i creep myself out when i realized that i've manipulated a situation successfully in order to create a more pleasant environment for the people around me . it scares me to think about ... i believe infjs may let relationships happen sometimes b / c of their genuine love for others , and desire to make others happy , connect and be understood . we don't think enough ( in a logical way ) , we ...
