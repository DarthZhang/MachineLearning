' some stuff i did a while back . ... i notice that whenever i get down in the dumps , this eventually snowballs into self-destructive behavior . the process / vicious circle goes something like this : realize everything is inherently ... thanks for the reply ! yeah , traveling around , having odd jobs and stuff sounds great to be honest . would really love to do that . i'd never be able to study that way though , and i'm still wondering ... i am terrified . i think this psychology study just might not be for me after all . there's too much repetition , superficial information , memorization ... i really like psychology but i can't keep up ... i've been feeling unusually alone and anhedonic . nothing really seems to do much for me anymore . ever since i started going to university i've just felt rather numb . i miss creativity . i feel like ... as a dude i actually love picking out new outfits and whatnot , the only thing holding me back is money really . which sucks because i tend to like the most expensive stuff . recently my taste has ... thanks guys , i'll just keep on going and see where it'll bring me , can't do much else i suppose ! i'm in my first year of university , studying psychology . i really want to move out , partially because it'd be beneficial to the time it takes to travel to the university , but mostly because i just ... i hope this is the right place for such things . i can't really express my current feelings anywhere , and just writing it down for myself doesn't seem to work , so yeah . hope someone can give me some ... haven't been on this site for a long time . all the things i've posted here are pretty idiotic , but let's give another stream-of-conscious thing a go . i remember this was one of my favorite threads ... i like to tell myself that the more intelligent you are , the worse you are at keeping up with stuff like visual impulses heh . not true though , probably . i don't know if it's an intp thing , but ... yeah . intps tend to be chameleons . most people , even close friends , think i'm an enfp at first . i just like talking a lot , and i've always been very preoccupied with analyzing emotions in myself ... yeah , i had that happen to me quite often . especially in middle school people would giggle instead of understand what i was saying when i unexpectedly threw out certain words . ( i had this a lot when ... i wish i had more control over my subconscious needs and emotions . yeah i definitely agree ! nothing to add hah . mmhm . i think it might have to do with vulnerability , i can definitely relate to the trust issues . and the fear of being a very boring person to the other is something i struggle with as well . i like ... life's boring without making out is what my mind whispers now and then . even though i lack any experience in that department . i'd better stop running away from those situations when they present ... * ntp here . i'm also somewhat of a people pleaser . i understand how nice it is to get help sometimes , so i help others out . i don't really care about getting help in return . i know that most of the ... thanks ! :) yeah , i'll just have to pretend i'm decisive , hah . i'm pretty confident - confident enough to take my time and not be afraid of being open about my weaknesses with people . confidence ... i failed once again . this time it really came as a surprise . i drove safely , at a normal speed , stopped when i had to stop , continued when i had to continue ... it went fine . i felt concentrated ... i eat enough iron i think ... :P never really thought much about it . i did have a rare kind of anemia as a child , though , but i never noticed anything . it was my parents who noticed i was unusually ... phew , thanks for the reply ! it's good to know i'm not the only one . yeah , i'm just training driving a lot now , hoping i'll be able to stay concentrated enough for the exam ... sometimes i'm able to ... i have my driving exam in two days , and frankly , i'm not very confident about it . this is the second time i'm giving it a try . i can drive well . that is if my mind doesn't get all foggy and ... i think you'd be better off doing what you feel is best , and not asking people on the internet who don't know you or the person you love . just do what you feel you should do . i don't think there ... hmmm . well , fashion is a very personal thing . it's hard to give someone else advice about it really , because it has to be something that's really kind of ... ' your thing ' . it's all personal ... damn , this is pretty freakin ' good ... the weird thing is : i've never hallucinated . i've never heard voices . schizophrenia doesn't run in my family ... i'm just extremely afraid of going mad for some reason . my sanity is all i have , ... i'm torn between individualist ( 4 ) , enthusiast ( 7 ) , peacemaker ( 9 ) and investigator ( 5 ) . i relate to them all depending on my current situation . but then again , this division of different aspects ... this thread is quite old by now ... but thanks for all the comments ! i haven't seen her in a while ( summer holidays and such ) , but we've been getting along a lot better . i suppose she was just ... i'm stuck . i feel like i'm going mad . i have this irrational fear of hearing voices now , and i keep checking if i'm not hallucinating . i constantly feel anxious . the reason for this is that i haven't ... i just ate too much food , and i feel terribly anxious and strange . i rolled a joint earlier but i think i'm going to skip smoking it for now , something's bugging me , and getting high when already ... ooooh , in this case , i know exactly what you're talking about , yeah . like ... it feels like 90 % of the people are just really dumb / fake and egocentric . and it's really disappointing when you think ... i like flirting . i like meeting new people . it's fun . as long as they aren't really creepy / clingy / annoying / close-minded . i don't get what you're talking about . i sometimes think i hate all ... ah yeah , that does seem very unlikely to me . i don't remember the last time i've laughed either to be honest . probably today or so , since i laugh quite a lot , but i'm not sure . i have terrible emotional memory . i don't know when i was last ... my laugh differs a lot , i tend to subconsciously mimic the laugh of the people i'm with a little . i think i read an article a while ago about how everybody does that though , so eh . for as far as i ... ah cool , so what does she think of it ? pretty curious now . the more i read these sort of threads ( and have made them myself ) , the more i realize people on the internet can't really help you with this sort of thing . or well , they can give you a vague ... wow . that's seriously really brave of you . i envy that . even though it might've not ended up as well as you might've hoped , it didn't go completely wrong ! i'm curious to hear more updates man . i ... yeah , that's pretty much how i view it too . in that case , i really do fall just in the middle . it surprises me that there's not a majority of people in this midway between of introversion and ... leat sa1988 graficcha thanks for all your descriptions / thoughts on this :) i do understand the bit about external stimuli being exhausting for an introvert , but aren't they eventually ... eh ... i've given up labeling myself as introvert or extravert . it's too vague . nobody lives their entire life viewing everything ' internally ' or ' externally ' . how is one cognitively ' extraverted ' ? ... it makes me happy and more confident . the fullness of my stomach really influences it a lot though . if i've eaten a big meal beforehand , i tend to drink about 6 beers on a night . if my stomach is ... i'm still experiencing the afterglow of bong hits . i never knew these things were that awesome . the high seems to be different from smoking a joint too , much more clear-headed . very nice . instead of ... enfj mom i * fp dad my mom is a workaholic and my dad is highly idealistic and is rather prone to depression . both very kind people though . i love them and appreciate them . they did a great job ... oh one of my friends is an enfp . we click really well . always knows when i've got something negative on my mind , and then helps me get rid of it . she seems to understand me quite well . on the other ... i work out every now and then . last year i got pretty into it , going to the gym 3 times a week doing cardio and lifting weights . i did that for 4 months or so i think , and then i fell back again ... if you didn't help the op , you surely helped me , haha ! i've practically been in his situation for over a year . my conversations with her about the issue went exactly as you pointed out . she always ... hmmm , pewdiepie is a hard one for me . entp ? enfp ? just really wild guesses . he doesn't seem much like a sensor to me , seems like an ne-dom . that's all i can really think of . yeah exactly . i suppose i'll grow to like it once i'm able to focus better , but eh . driving a car in a city is a drag indeed . constantly having to slow down for pedestrians , people randomly ...
