like what to say in the message and what not ? i don't want to come off too deep or cheesy . well , i find that very awkward for me lol . should i wait ' til he's off in college and text him there ? that way when he comes back on the weekends or something we can talk as soon as he gets home ?

i don't see how that can help me ... but thanks anyways :) i have my own ways of attracting girls but the problem here is deciding which one . i'm an estp ; i don't look long term . commitments make me dread and to say i have to stay with one girl for the rest of my life i think i'd go crazy . i've taken that into consideration as well . maybe i'm not ready or it'd be more wise to wait . ahhh , i forgot to mention to ask if i should spend more time with the infj ! the problem here is she goes to a different school and meeting up isn't as convenient . but i will keep that in mind ... :D i just glanced over the sex and relationships section and it seems to me that i will get better answers if i posted in specific personality sections ; i can get different commentary from the same ... hey everyone ! i want to share a brief background knowledge about my relationship between these two girls in order to help your understanding . i'm going to post this in other personality categories ... hey everyone ! i want to share a brief background knowledge about my relationship between these two girls in order to help your understanding . i'm going to post this in other personality categories ... hey everyone ! i want to share a brief background knowledge about my relationship between these two girls in order to help your understanding . i'm going to post this in other personality categories to ... hmm .. seems like you need to meet an estp ! we're very outgoing , fun and just in general , great people to be with ! depending on the estp , he can fill in your weaknesses and bring you up when you're ... well as an introverted , shouldn't you be alright with being alone ? i get energetic and more hyper when i'm around lots of friends and we're having a good conversation , and when i'm at home by myself , ... it depends on how mad i get ... if people are there and i feel very humiliated his ass is going down i know this thread is kind of old ... but how is this situation going for you ? really ? maybe i'm not mature enough or haven't met the right intj . i don't think you guys have met an intj then ... their thoughts are over the top complicated . i just realized something : infps never give up . i used to like this infp girl , but after i got to know her personality ... jeez . she never admits she's wrong . elvis pretty much nailed it here : i don't know if i'm the only one , but when i am opened to more than one option , i have the hardest time deciding . i don't know which one to choose because i feel that if i choose one i might miss out ... but dude ... you're an enfp . gtfo plz . lol jk . i say that's what she said jokes a lot . there we go ! that's something i was looking forward into hearing ! you're very right about this part too : now that i think about it , working your ass of now can in ways make my future easier ... but ...
