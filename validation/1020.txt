' i would have guessed entp , seems heavy ne-ti going on . best of luck with trying to manipulate as compensation for being unliked , and trying to project your low self confidence . that friend of mine didn't do anything to get her back to me , he just made it ... you don't have to envy my relationship to be downright pathetic . something tells me my former friend is worse than you though , simply because he's a better salesman at making destructive advice ... i'm destined to keep messing up with her . i didn't even mention what i did that made her not want me to talk to her . unless someone could somehow direct her to this thread lol it was love plain and simple , we had a deep emotional connection but then i became obsessed with control after she felt a need to take an official break and fuck her other ex . anyway . you sound ... it was more that i was looking at these interactions in a detached cause / effect kind of way , and didn't understand how it all worked until i saw it fall apart . this is what i meant by dangerously biting off more than can be chewed , it sets up unrealistic expectations if i'm gonna be that bold about making long term future plans , then any mistake is gonna be ... so actually this all happened months ago , before she saw reasons to believe i was trying to hurt somebody . once she saw that , she decided we actually weren't meant for each other . i tried convincing ... i understand this may be going off on a limb , but basically what happened was a crisis that had broken up isfj and me . then a friend of mine had convinced me that if i wanted her back , i should ... i won't ask about the details haha , but was there always more chemistry between you and him than say ... you and some estp ? which types have you felt most attraction towards ? is it knowing that the other person wants them to feel good , as much as knowing that you're allowing the other person to be pleased ? what would he have to improve to be objectively the best ? oh come on now , you're just saying that . how could ne possibly compare to se in terms of physically reactive accommodation to your needs in the moment ? is it possible ? i'm gonna artificially clone ... so i'm getting that estps are a hard act to follow in terms of raw focus , and reactivity to the partner , yet in multiple documented cases they might be in it for the recreational sport and not forge ... if i may probe just a little further , what was so fun about the entp ? i was curious to see if there was perhaps any anecdotal correlation between sexual chemistry and mbti types of partners . my spirit is no match against the left-wing society y'all aren't the enemy , pfff lol if only you understood the masculine mindset of how sex is war : laughing : realistically , how is that going to actually happen , other than maybe after enough mental gymnastics to convince yourself that the king = some abstract concept within one's own solipsistic universe ? apparently i only like ruminating nostalgically , listening to music , and coming up with creative ideas . chess and strategies are potential means to an end , i guess . well , honing the instinct and focus into a particular environment , pace , rhythm etc . can be learned . i certainly have odd ne ideas ... sometimes a little too weird for the other person happy about nothing . gilly i'd genuinely be interested in learning how to be like your experiences , if possible : cool : that's what i want to know . disregarding emotional attachment to the partner , i wonder if there's any way to be better than an sp in this area , what their weaknesses might be etc . he would keep wishing to modify the allowed-move-properties of his various pieces to optimise his strategy , find that that isn't allowed , and ask to start the game afresh read that somewhere . ... and what made it so ? female answers preferred . and what made it so ? female answers preferred . and what made it so ? female answers preferred . and what made it so ? female answers preferred . statistically , estp-isfj relationships don't usually work out long term . also , girls who live with their friends-with-benefits often end up in bigger messes than they planned for . side note - ... yeah but what i meant was , is a guy gonna compare himself not in terms of his sexual ability once in the act , but in the overall aura of dominance and ability to attract . i know that not all estps ... good vs bad subtypes does it make you feel better to see yourself as the most alpha guy that a girl has been with ? do estps bother to try one-upping the one who beat them ? or do they tend to accept it , forget it and move on yeah they're not listed . meh , intjs don't generally break enough rules in my experience . guess it depends on who though . i like your undermining idea better than the dog shit one . now i need to find out why ej would ... - simple ways to get someone's home and / or work address ( without asking ) , and realistic things you could do with that - for starters list any career with an easily-formed work habit , that doesn't ... i'm tired of all the ne brainstorming that looks awesome in theory but ends up going nowhere . i know an enfj who broke into his ex's house to leave a strangulation cord . i don't mean to downplay the fact that i seemed nuts because i was at the time , but my actions were creepy at most . time ... that's why if you ever have a daughter , don't let her get drunk around guys who have game + irresponsible se autopilot . can't blame her for doing the abuse . compared to your state of mind , i'm ... bro have you tried to translate human relationship intricacies into ti / convert to vector image ? am i going crazy and / or hyper-rational ? it longs for the past with melancholy , and pines for her ... very interesting . okay here's the story time . what happened was that her previous sort of ex before me ( let's call him estp ) , got her drunk enough to one night stand before she left to ... both types use ti and ni to the degree that they understand them , but intp is ti master and intj is ni master . intp is much stronger at ne and uses it all the time , whereas intj does the same with ... isfj 1w9 ex girlfriend decided we weren't meant to be , after she learned how i dealt with anger . she seemed to give me a chance on everything else , but that was the straw that broke the camel's ... type 9 is my body triad , though . it might be no coincidence that i get more 9 - ish after being more physical . 1 ) i never take rejection personally . i'd feel more fucked if i had never done anything to make an attempt . there are also smart and tactless ways to go about courting someone , it makes the most ... it's not very often that i access any truer deeper feelings about someone / something , aside from the more frequent shallow ego feelings such as fear or anger . but i've realized that those deceive and ... i make sure to not react and then keep tabs on sarcastic intj passive-aggressiveness , so that the next time i'm alone with them in a room , i'll surprise punch them in the side of the head with zero ... hi , due to a dire period involving internet privacy i require my username changed to mental blockstack . thank you live more in the present and realize that nobody else notices / cares about these things as much as you do . i'm not sure exactly what it is you're trying to express with style , but i can say that it ...
