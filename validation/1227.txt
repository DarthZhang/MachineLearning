' wicked game the weekend . i don't flirt really . hah ! j / k . if i have no interest i simply don't talk . but if i do then i would approach the person of interest and spark a conversation since i'm really good at it . i live in my own world . i was single for the past decade so it seems . it was the best years of my life till now that i'm happily taken by someone so wonderful . it really happened when i least ... one who can make me cry since it's nearly impossible for me to cry over anything . never . i prefer to appear oblivious . nope . i've known this since i was a child . i take it as a compliment . lol i've seen him sneak glances at me plenty of times . he talks to everyone else but me and when he does he'd get bloody sarcastic . being an introvert , i find it difficult to converse with him . imho , it's a possibility that he doesn't like me . correct me ... i never knew there are such people . they are loving and caring and so much fun to be around ! seems like they love everyone . what signs would an enfp show if he has interest in dating you ? absolutely . it's something i've never been able to explain w / out coming off a little crazy . spending time with them . buying stuff for them . i can't think of anything else . it's rare . i've been in several relationships in the past but have only fallen in love once . i did begin to have feelings for someone but he was too busy in love with someone else's significant ... my result is 29 i never cease to amaze myself . i play draw my thing on facebook . made high scores . no one wants to play me anymore so in the meantime i give that attention to my nostrils . they're quite amusing . true . my back up plan would be to catch a bit of their story and emphasize on it as if i listened . irl i usually don't talk to anyone unless they are very close and dear to me . my church and ... i recall collecting books . i had a pet cat . i didn't like the typical toys . i have more self confidence than it appears to be . perhaps , i enjoy the underestimation of others . i seriously have something like this on my facebook : i seriously have something like this on my facebook . i have done so plenty of times in the past . it's actually a recurring predicament that i position myself . i haven't yet found a way out . i sometimes just nod to avoid hurting others . it works most ... my eyes hert from reading these posts we're all double ds with mini skirts . no one irl would ever know i'm intj . yes , they know i'm an introvert but i would never disclose which type . it's none of anyones business . no dating sites of any kind . only forums . i'm a christian . i don't see it as a religion . i see it as the truth . lol my mother . if i didn't plan for that it wouldn't happen . i have better things to do than to sit and socialize . lol it's highly likely that i wouldn't . people usually find me intimidating . no one i know seems to understand why i am this way ^ myself-my ex-one of my nephews and one of my nieces are intjs . the only time anyone would ever have the opportunity to meet one of us would be at our home , work , or school . we do not go to social ... i hate being expected to hug and i hate being hugged . only close family members get hugs or are allowed to hug me . even at that , i still feel like gggrrr . sometimes . i remember especially social security numbers . haha ! very true . never easily but deeply yes . enfps are fun to be around . i greatly enjoy their company . in fact , i really really like an enfp but he mentioned once that the feeling was not mutual . i left it as is . not to say , that i gave up or ... why of course ! you know he love you . since we love the person , we don't mind . we just laugh at ourselves inside as well . i totally agree with the snapping . i have been called out on this numerous times at work especially . it is just part of me . the death stare as well . intjs usually don't keep close connection with their ex's . i don't . it took me almost five years to change my mindset about my intj ex . he doesn't use harsh words but he takes action in cold and ... door slamming is possible with all circumstances . not really . wake up . turn on my computer . go onto youtube and put on my playlist . take a shower . breakfast . read read read . log into my facebook . write my thoughts in my notes that i keep only to myself . poems ... i'm not afraid of discussing my feelings with those i do trust . but then again , i trust very few . to be completely honest , i actually haven't disclose anything in depth with anyone . i write in my ... if i had a lover i'd be roaming around in my birthday suit and making love all day . singing learning forums looking ridiculously sexy . manipulating people ( obstacles ) if they get in my way . on my computer web surfing or reading articles / news . book store / library whenever i ... well paid assassinator . love making ? yes . having sex ? no . one nighties ? never . i suppose this is part of my nature . it's likely due to the fact that i feel that anyone i do not know is less of importance to me therefore the lack of emotional response . whereas those i know are ... i don't hate it . i show it whenever nature calls . it would be fake for me to try to overdo it just to appear to be like others .
