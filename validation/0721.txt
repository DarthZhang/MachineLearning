' ok i give up cmon people up someone has an idea on his type ? mbti , enneagram , anything ?  ted bundy had a lot of potential , and he screwed it all up just to kill some people . the guy is the stereotype of the nihilist that doensn't see a sense in his life . it seems to me like serial killers value so much the fact of killing people that they ignore their life ( risks , money , time , ... ) for that . doesn't seem like a judging trait , to say the least . yes i know that . but you missed my point again . i can have reasons know , mmm let's say reallly big reasons to kill that neighbor ( totally made up ) that i hate and all . but then am i gonna do it ? ... i think you nailed it my friend . nope , i don't think enjoying something is enough to do it . i'll say it another way . two possibilities in life : you're poor , then you have to work more to get money ... so everybody who is different that the mass has a personality disorder ? it's funny how depending on the context , the notion of personality disorder changes . a dictator can be seen ( avoided the ... yes , i may take myself into account when i talk about that since i'm supposed to be the same type . but still , i can think objectively and detach from myself when thinking in general . and yes , i think ... i know a lot about human psychology ( no pretention here ) , everybody does to some extent . i shouldn't have to prove myself , i've read a lot of articles on a bunch of different subjects in psychology ... it's funny that you attack my behaviour when worse can be said of yours . no offense , just sayin ' yes indeed , maybe they can become efficient at killing people for the sake of killing , but in my ( sane ^ ^ ) mind , such work is useless . you waste a lot , you risk a lot , and what do you earn in return ... how could it make their life easier ? i'd say it would be the contrary . but i get what you mean . exactly ! that's exactly what i was trying to say ! it's so unefficient and unhealthy to spend so much time and energy just for the sake of killing a person without motive . it's really ... yeah i understand , not all entjs are the same regardless of enneagram , and especially if you add enneagram and / or other systems . indeed , they will display a lot of differences , maybe making some ... i'm sorry i've disturbed your ti sharpness is such small details yeah , estp is possible too . of course any type can kill , as long as you have a knife or whatever and hands , you can . but . children mostly don't kill . there almost have never been any infp dictator ... ffs , you seem to turn around my point on purpose . i already agreed that entjs can be serial killers ( like patrick bateman indeed ) . that's not what i want to say . i think a j would need a much ... yes , yes ... but i mean even if you enjoy it ... it's like a waste a time imo , there are so many things more important to do , why waste time in planning and stalking a person for weeks just to kill ... yeah i know that , but if i may , you missed my point . of course any mbti type can become a serial killer . but it's about proportion . i know a lot about serial killers and it's precisely why i ask this ... it seems to me like the serial killing is more a ti-fe thing , and requires a bit unstability , hence p , extp seem to be the most represented among serial killers ( ted bundy was probably entp ) . do ... i don't think we can take her mbti tests results into consideration , since we all know how mileading online tests can be , especially paradoxically when we actually don't know the the theroy behind ... yeah , forget what i said , she's estp , just watched a few more videos she doesn't have so much fi values . there was a video where she was reading mean comments ( and some of them were really hurtful , i felt bad for her ) and she took it quite good . i think an fi user ... ok =) i'm totally fine prada =) you're right , maybe these combinations do exist . prada ok you win , i'm tired of that debate , maybe you're right at the end of the day . yeah .. idk . enneagram is about motivation more than behaviour imo otherwise you'd make the same mistyping as what you said about them when they don't resemble anything stereotypical . and when you ... you may be right about her being isfp . the thing is , i don't see her as impulsive as isxps are ( generally speaking ) . for example there's nika volek in the show , that someone typed as isfp , whose se ... there were also entj 4s , 9s and 2s if we have seen the same stats by the past . does entj 4 make sense to you ? what would it look like ? i'd like to see how te can focus on practicality when it's in ... that's why i said mainly :p i know you guys entj 1s exist but the majority must be 8s i think . 1 is more an stj type to me , because the values of 1ness are too restrictive , which contradicts the ... by definition , entj has te > ni and se > fi . anyone who claims to be entj and doens't respond to this is not entj . by definition , intj has ni > te and fi > se . anyone who claims to be intj and ... haha xd yes i agree , it's a natural tendency for me to classify . i've seen isfp , isfj , infp and infj for her ( all the ixfx ) so i think it's not easy to type her . we have to consider her damaged life ... erf :/ ok well you find one that's ok then :) i've heard of survey monkey , i think it can work . michael : intj who has too many emotions , so he looks like an f sometimes lincoln : istp sara : isfj , i mean , she's a nurse , i think she's almost the same type ( including enneagram ) as the blonde ... he looks like patrick bateman , which is entj 3 . in some way , he looks like me too , but not really ( i'm an 8 , quite different , i relate to people in some way , i have narcissistic moments , but they ... you can't already restrain it to a letter or a function , it would be biased , we need all data first before implying that it's linked to this or that make it simple : 3 polls in the same thread ( if that's possible ? i never tried it ) : mbti , enneagram and d & d alignment , then someone ( or many ) would correlate results and share their views edit : ... i lean towards true neutral , and i'm entj 8w7 sp / sx . someone mentioned a poll , i think it's a great idea . i thought for a very long time i was infj , until i understood that functionally , i am an entj . you guys watch fucking weird things . hey people , what do you think this guy is : i wanted to put a spoiler tag but i don't know how to , or maybe it's not possible . anyway , my guess ... not sure i understand what you mean . so what's your guess of the types ? what's wrong with the forum ? i guess i wouldn't care at all and let them do their business , unless of course a close person is involved like my family or my girlfriend in which case i would be able to kill anybody to protect my ... has anybody seen that movie omg cmon people ? it's an amazing movie . hey , which type do you think the characters from funny games us are ? mbti , enneagram if you can , whatever . for those who haven't seen it , it's an excellent movie . everywhere :) i will develop when my projects evolve and take proportion an application that will give you the type of the people you see in the street and their compatibility with you ( analyzing ...
