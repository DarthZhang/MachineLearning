' yep , i'm esfj . hooray ! big 5 is worthless , i don't see why anyone would be interested in taking it . i mean , even if it is scientific and all that , it doesn't do anything . you take the test , you find out you're high in ... i spent 4 years in the military . it was probably the most miserable time of my life , but i think it was better than hanging around home . and yes , it definitely grates against our personality , but i ... the infp wasn't nearly as draining as the infj . i have dated both infxs , and i must say i'll never go through that again . the infj really had a way of making me feel inferior like she always said i didn't know what i want and i should be more ... i think mine work against each other . 3w2 and isfp ? wtf is that ? i'm really lazy , but i still want to achieve things . i'm usually torn between being nice and getting something done . i try to do ... i'm not really artistic either . i doodle a lot though , and i have an eye for presentation and how to make something look good . i think beavis from bevis and butthead is an isfp . aren't isfps supposed to be somewhat humble ? he called himself the king of pop , he had a giant 50 foot statue of himself in one of his albums . i don't think isfps show themselves off like that . it's hard to tell the difference sometimes . i'm right on the edge of s / n , but the thing is that i identify more with intp than i do with infp , but i know i'm a feeling type , so i was kinda stuck on ... i always need more sleep , but i never seem to have time for it during the week . i make it up on the weekend . well something like a week before the test , or at the beginning of the quarter he said he wouldn't ask us to write any code on the test . but the first question said write a method and on the day ... no , that's how he is all the time , but not all are that bad . i'm in computer science and sometimes i have to wrestle with the entps to get a solid answer . i have this terrible entp professor . he gave us a test where the highest score was a 75 % . he was wondering why we did terribly and i told him that the way he worded the questions was too open ended ... nigella lawson : hehe here's some real eye candy : am i the only one entps don't argue with ? why do you think that is ? may i recommend isfps ? : crazy : i think people take what i say too literally , like it takes a certain kind of person to pick up on the meaning hidden behind my words , or at least to ask hey what did you mean by that ? i guess i'm ... christina hendricks : not all of us are cynical though . so if you help someone hoping to benefit from it in any way , you're being selfish ? i think everyone's selfish in that way , unless you're buddha or something . no one would help anyone if at all if ... i can be kind , or i can be vicious . i have the ability to set my feelings aside to get something done , and something very good or very bad can come of it . whenever i do something nice for someone , ... i think being isfp kiiicks ass . i wouldn't mind being a type that has more initiative though . i wish i could change the office culture / environment . i haaate it . look , my entp friends , don't let anyone tell you how you should or shouldn't act . if someone can't handle your honesty then don't sweat it . you wont get along with some people no matter what , so ... it's usually the ntjs that i feel the most awkward around . with most ntps ( there are a few notable exceptions ) it's like we're friends , but i just don't feel motivated to hang out with them a lot . ... big bad wolf , you sir , are mr . awesome . those poor souls : laughing :  i like these this is what ultimately steered me away from 9 or 4 and towards 3 . a very useful tool imo . oh yes , esfjs are crazy fun to mess with : wink : you're used to messing with angry isfps ? brave man . but seriously , you don't have to win every argument . some people just want to express themselves , and they don't care if they're convincing ... well arguing with me is like a losing battle automatically because even if you do win the immediate argument , you come off as a complete jerk and i start to get mad . you don't want to mess with an ... lol one of those people . we are friends . he's entp . what's important is that he doesn't dismiss what i'm saying because i get mad when that happens . * hint * * hint * when you don't listen it can get frustrating . i've gotten good at circumventing arguments completely though , so i'm improving . whenever me and my friend argue , it's basically me saying what i want ... entps are my favorite people , but at the same time the only type of person i have gotten into real fist fights with . there are worse types out there , trust me huzzah ! she seems to be warming up to me . i guess it just took some time , but yea i was asking her for a lot of help on my labs ( not too much though ) : cool : you sound a lot like me , op . i thought i was being objective , but instead i have zero self esteem and only evaluate myself by what others say about me . gl bro . it doesn't matter what other ... there's this one entp that might like me , but i really have no idea . she's starting to act weird and shy around me , but i dunno maybe that's just the way she is ? she's adorable . i don't really ... my first real relationship was with an infj . i didn't think it was a good match . trying to please her proved nearly impossible . that's sort of the problem with benefit relationships . the ... how do isfp make it big in their careers ? i'd say first find something you're passionate about . if you just want a job , then that's fine , but if you want to make it big you need to have passion ... i <3 huckabees is one of my favorite movies lol welcome lol let me find my pokeball welcome to the forum i would like to join the peace corps after i graduate in a year . it's a funny thing to do with a computer science degree , but getting into the programming world just doesn't really appeal to me . i ... one of my things that hinted at isfp for me was that i can't stop drawing on my notes during my classes . you can't hide the artist you are , no matter how hard everyone would like you to ! that must cost a fortune . worth every penny , i'm sure ! yea i'm definitely 3 . it's a strange combination , but it's like i go into entj mode when it's business time ( very stressful ) and fall back into isfp mode any chance i get . i too want to be useful , ... as far as i'm concerned , everything is awesome . even when i travel , i don't really see a need to go to all the best tourist attractions . i just like taking in the ambiance .
