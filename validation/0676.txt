sorry but i personally find this a very poor argument . don't do it . that's it . if u are married you should not be telling other guys that u have porn dreams with them as it would probably be taken as an invitation . it was just a dream , get down to earth ... in the case of me and my intj the roles would be the opposite . he wouldn't do any home duties ever ! nicely explained . i couldn't agree more :) the last sentence is sooo true ! again , a bit of time alone is good for each one of them , both types require alone time to recharge since the interaccion with each other is quite consuming . so yeah ! lol i think we can be both for as i've seen so far . in my case i am personally too attracted to my intj's complex mind to have him only as a friend ... : blushed : for some inexplicable reason ( yet ) intj and infp get along in a way i cannot explain lol intjs for-e-ver ! anyway , my favorite words are : unrequited ( love ) celtic ( i love how it sounds ) serendipity ( i like the concept and how it sounds ) and some others that right now don't come to my mind ... i do that aswell ! i called my ex ( this is gonna sound cheesy ) kuru , i don't know why , and then started calling him bebe ( spanish for baby ) but that was boring so the word mutated to bubu , then ... hahahaha omg your mind flies 3000 million light years farrr i've done it , but at the end doesn't work ... i made myself the same question loads of times and wondered whether i was being an unhearted person because of that . but the truth is , we are programmed to ... hahahaha good answer ! skaftafell , why do you ask for infp / intj advise if your profile says that u are infj ? just wondering . could you give examples of what sentences show use of extraverted feeling and sentences that show use of introverted intuition ? thanks welcome to infp club . isn't that the use of fi ? and why no one has mentioned the unicorns yet ? lol beware of entps ! they are not only smart in the logical way , they also are very skilled when it comes to intrapersonal matters . i had an entp bf , and oh boy ! i could see the way he manipulates ... guys , all of you , intj are f up in your brains ! lol i love when intj get on a silly mode , you can be really funny and cute heheh i miss so much my intj ex ... : sad : and he also loved cuddles and ... lol that happens ! but if you really like someone you are not that shy . correct me if i am wrong ;) '
