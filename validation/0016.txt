) but cole seems kind of intj and dylan seems almost esfp .. i'll have to look into them more i'm probably not quite right . old thread , i know . but she's almost certainly an isfp in my opinion . i'm an isfp too , so it could be that i'm just really aware of when she's using isfp functions , because i know them so well . ... hm , on second thought he could be intj . same functions as isfp ( fi se ni te ) but in a different order ( ni te fi se ) . or entj ( te ni se fi ) . he seems like me ( isfp ) except 1000x more brash and 1000x less reserved .. like if i had absolutely no inhibitions at all . like me , but high on caffeine and infinitely confident and infinitely less ... i relate to that more than i relate to anything else , i guess ?
