' just saying dark matter could be something even absorbed with eyesight or observation . a supernatural element or even spiritual . which would even explain its unexplainability by scientists . xd umm , just agree to try new things we may invite you to try and even if you don't like ( probably will ) just let us finish doing it anyway while pretending you do like it . then later the next day ... this is a short lesson on said quantum mechanics . awesome topic for intj's . why ? because we know we can solve the unsolvable . i just want to take this time to purpose a true question while inviting a topic that was meant for intj's . who thinks they can solve quantum mechanics ? let me be first to say , being an intj i know it ... so fucking ! ! ! ( < ~ ~ ~ like a schizophrenic ) true . awesome story . hate that we have to be different . sometime it helps to just think of all the things you want to do to them while just shaking your head yes followed by a calm and collected ok . lol . i know . im wondering how this happened to me . i never have gotten close to anyone untill now . she was an isfp . she went to go see her ex in jail and got confused so i broke it off with her . this is the first ... i think its obvious we can make awsome maicians . i think it safe to say we all loved the movie or mind behind now you see me . given the talent of being masteminds , its true we have all thought up ... you know , you have a very valid point here . we should do something that doesn't evolve around religion or politics . i know what ever it is we do , we will prevail . lets do it . . . . and here . . . is ... yes , its very possible . and now that i have seen there more recent stuff i believe its not an intj's idea . though we would more likely be the ones behind the alluminati take over . lol . it true , i believe that very thing . im a christian and still think we are the stepping stones god gave to man . we want people to kniw this , but dont really like the attention that would go with it ... its just weird being an intj man . just weird . freakingly funny . xd i want to and feel entirely in agreement with tech's speculation in your selfdisplay of an obtusive spectical of yourself weird . lol . not bad , but how was your first point any less realistic if at all . lol . jk if only we all lived in an environment that allowed us to stay satisfactorily happy with who we are while around people . however , easily knowing what others are thinking , it makes it difficult when ... i have never heard it put in such a selfeluding correct manner . thank you for your post . and i guess screaming match was the inappropriate word . and i meant it as a compliment weird , honestly . its good that you dont give up . ah , forums , they bring everyone together . thats cool with me , lol . i admire your adamant character on topics you feel need to be explained . i mean a person normally gives up after a while , but you kept going even when an outside source came ... indeed , its dumb . and your right , there are no rolls you have to fit . theres not normally a good reason to fight amongst intjs so a trivial , meaningless argument is as good as it gets , lol . thank you ... elaberation is something intjs do well . true that a sensation of isolation can come about . however i believe the these feelings of isolation , out of place and even secluded behavior are all different ways of explaining a problem most intjs ... mmm , truth be old i thnk that other types are meant to learn about each other through visiting topics of and in each other . so accurately assuming your roll in not participateing in this manner of ... she brings validity to her argument man . i agree with the iq not measuring ones mind accurately . you are sexy my dear . feel free to check my profile and see if i meet said sexiness . lol . simple , we dont react to anything stupid in public , people see it and realize there is no reason to react to such stuff so naturally they want to be like us . we are smarter . people want to be ... ahh , and those ignorant fools who choose to be so . stupid shows like the view . never ending debates that should have ended a while ago like which came first ? the chicken or the egg ? when a verbal disagreement takes place and rather than the opposer admitting there failer in believes or facts they choose to look dumb just so you cant officially win . hmm , i suppose you make alot of sense in this statment . i dont want to feel like im over or superior to everyone else . thats just big headed and outrageous , not to mention a thing i hate in others ... thank you and i understand how you feel on that . tis why i wanted to start this thread . to see if others thought the same way about the general population . now , seeing as this is a thread for venting and such , im going to assume you were talking in reference to the people you were currently showing attentiveness to on said tv . in reference to the ... im curious as to whether or not you were refering to laurie or the people your currently watching on television . i you were referencing laurie a posted link to that would be rather nice to better ... indeed the earth is full of immaturally descending behavior . in an essence to preserve respect for your barely fellow race , we shouldn't try to compare ourselves to them at all , rather compare them ... well cetanu , i would like to think we are not sociopaths . . . but by definition i believe we are due to our personalities . people have made us into a desease to study rather than calling it what it ... watch , when they come back for us and we get back home , we will be the dumb ones . misunderstood for the opposite reasons . its not my kind of movie , but i have seen it . if you watch it you will understand the mothership reference youvmentioned , lol . try to watch till the end . thats the mothership kicker . im a christian aswell . i dont think there are many of us i n th intj community though . i think its the general over abundance of logic seakers in our personality . agreed . . . xd , i just lauphed sooo hard . that was funny , their own little snowflake lol . yep , i would say you hit it right on the nail . thats how my mom is , it gets under my skin that she has no interest in ... understandible . though your not an intj , would you still care to elaborate ? ah , xd your one that has seen you me and duppree . he hit home with that speech . im curious if all intjs reference movies alot or if its just me . perhaps because we read character so well we remember ... that must have sucked being forced to be someone your not instinctually . thank you for your input , but you don't ever feel the majority of people are alot dumber than you ? ok , more of a political thread , but i feel anonymous could be made up mostly of intj's . now im not saying im part of the group due to them recently declaring war on the united states goverment , but ... being an intj , i feel so out of place with everyone around me . however my mom is efsp . efsp's are the worst to live with an intj . anyway , do other intj's feel like the rest of the world is ... halo ( because the story is awsome ! ) pokemon for the advance , dead island , left for dead , love final fantasy games ( mainly the older ones ) . and recently chess and all stars for the ps vita . xd me aswell !
