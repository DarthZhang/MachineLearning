' i get typed as both a 4w5 and 5w6 as well but just like you consider myself to be a 4w5 . it fits me perfectly so i don't understand why it always fluctuates to 5w6 lol for a solid week now . shower song of choice o : 64 c : 34 e : 0 a : 73 n : 92 apparently i'm not friendly at all , but depending on the situation even though i can be standoffish , i can adapt to be friendly . that neurotic score scares me a ... omg congrats ~ ! : 3 aya saves the world imagine your friend sending you pictures through the whole thing : blushed : aya saves the world yes , it really is : 3 my friend went to a concert of theirs and said it was amazing aya saves the world alleyways & honest are good as well : tongue : aya saves the world you have great taste , i love that song ! joydreamer #13 , oh my god , i thought i was the only one who was that way lol 1 . i have more freckles than the average freckled person 2 . kind of a pluviophile ( a lover of rain ) 3 . i have two cats that i shower with attention 4 . hopelessly romantic . this one's a flaw 5 ... invisiblegirl of course ; and you're cool as well for saying it c : i made it black and white because this was a snow day ( a rarity ) and the lighting was weird . hello everyone . : 3 198098 my mom is an istj and we fight almost every time we're in the same room . i do not mean to offend other istj's at all , by the way . perhaps it is a phase , but as the mbti gods say , our communication ... whenever someone is having a bad day , remember that i walked into the men's bathroom while looking down at my phone . made eye contact with a guy washing his hands , slowly backed out , and almost ... in the beginning , i would write in my diary everyday . sometimes twice a day . suddenly i lost motivation , leaving it to collect dust in the corner of my room for months until i found it and felt like ... pale blue eyes bringing the depth of the ocean and the shallowness of the shore the shadowy bottoms below and the familiar skylight above the waves rush to greet my feet and then they surely ... hey , welcome to perc ! : kitteh : you'll find a lot of awesome people here . usually suspicion , because i don't feel like they actually have an interest in me at all , they're just messing with me or they aren't as serious as i am about it isfj multiple times and isfp once , isfj describes me fairly well but infj a little better and so i decided to identify as an infj i'm absolutely terrible . most of the time i'm too busy staring at the trees or the sky while in the car . so when people ask me for directions , i'm pretty much of no use to them . i hate that people claim to be accepting of everyone but they have no problem ostracizing people that are different than them . i'm only competitive sometimes . in my old job it became very apparent at times . it wasn't that i was trying to be better than my coworkers , but to be the very best i could to improve my own opinion ... i couldn't have phrased this any better than you just did . bravo :p roud : and that makes a lot of sense . i idealize people a lot and i still don't understand it , lol . you're playing it smart by not doing this . i think sometimes if you truly want to like a person , it's easy to overlook their flaws until they become evident later in the friendship and you wonder how you could have judged the person so badly ... quite the opposite , if i like someone , i could give you a list of everything that they've ever done that made me like them . just give me a minute to think about it . 183746 my eyes look gray here but they're actually very green . christian delgrosso is my favorite , but i can't figure out what he and jessi smiles are . listening to all 3 of my roommates get ready to go to a party without me . and i don't really have any regrets . that kind of thing is always in the back of my mind , however it can't keep me from getting attached to people ; that just happens lol . sometimes i'll let my guard down accidentally . but if the ... welcome c : it's really difficult to be a feeler . it would be a hell of a lot easier to be heartless and cold . less pain in the end . there's lots of perc members willing to help here . it's lovely . this always seems to be a problem for me . however it's never me doing the heartbreaking . it's the other person i've wrapped up as you so eloquently put it . an extra cheesy pizza lunchable . classy and mature , i know . get on my level . don't freak out . i just started college and still have no idea what i want to do . of course i believe in soul mates and true love . what would the world be like if love didn't exist ?
