' so , it actually happened .. 604945 why , thank you :p roud : though these are not my absolute favs , i posted them earlier in the thread . i havent's seen anyone mention these , though they were really good : drama : anohana tokyo magnitude 8.0 ookami kodomo no ame to yuki comedy / drama : sakurasou no pet na kanojo shirobako actually i'm also learning the language :p roud : it certainly isn't as hard as it seems , though i'm learning all by myself . i highly recommend starting with kana mind then using human japanese ( both ... i'm definitely an agnostic . as long as religion is all about giving faith to people who need it in order to enjoy their lives , it's fine by me . but i'm not sure the case is so simple most of the ... i used to hate it too , but there's definitely nothing wrong about it and it's good that you've managed to come to terms with it . well .. i never thought that my interest in depth is more important or in any way better than others ' desires . we are different and i believe that their preferences are just as valid as mine . i prefer 1 on 1 conversations too . when i'm in a group other than my close friends , i'm hardly initiating any discussion . maybe it's because i really don't like to stand out . fancy meeting a fellow hungarian - and an infj at that - here . ( we are supposed to be rare , aren't we ? ) : cool : uhm , i mean welcome ! :p roud : ah , i see . glad to hear it and thanks for clearing it up . well , i think there are circumstances for every type where they have it easier or harder than others . well , i also don't make a habit out of simply going up to people and pointing out things i don't like , but if they inquire about my opinion on something , i always give them my honest thoughts on the ... that's beautifully put , thanks :p roud : this too . i was always drawn to that darkness ( sorrow , melancholy , sadness etc . ) , but it's important to remain in control and don't fear it . those who ... i used to think that too . in the past , it certainly would've helped , but know that i'm more aware , i wouldn't want to be any other type . if i'd say that i've come to terms with being an infj , that ... yes ! every mistake you make , you have to treat it as experience ( i simply call it xp , but i am a gamer : tongue 2 : ) . you learn the most from your own mistakes , because it's painful and hard to deal ... glassland man .. so many things you wrote resonated with me .. not being competitive , not being able to fit in , feeling i'm different and thinking that this is all because there's something wrong ... it started off pretty good , but somehow i lost interest maybe halfway through the first season , and i never felt the desire to finish it . edit : i've got more , but they are on the alternative ( rock ) side , not like the softer ones that were posted before me : listening_headphone edit 2 : ... this show is definitely my favourite ( drama ) series by far . i'm all for black humor and striking honesty , and this show combines both . my fav episode is still s01e03 ( the entire history of you ) ... well , initially , i included metalcore and post-hardcore too , which are my favourite genres , but the poll is limited to 20 choices , so i had to cut down the options . yes , and i believe that it's okay this way . i think it would make life easier for people if they just accepted this . at least based on my experiences . since i started caring more about myself , i'm ... i see , thanks for the heads up ! i'd recommend akame ga kill ! for survival , and for gore , another and corpse party : tortured souls . though the last one might feel a bit rushed as it's a game adaptation in 4 episodes , but i played ... yeah , well , as the article puts it : genre , like onex 92s personality type , is more a guide than a straightjacket , and wisdom is more readily found in the hidden nuances than in the broad strokes . ... i mostly prefer drama and slice of life stuff , where the focus is on the characters . my favourites : kotonoha no niwa ( most visually beautiful animation i've seen so far , with a pretty nice story ) ... i love it when it's overcast , just minutes before it starts to rain . being the biggest music junkie i know , i was always interested in the relationship between the different personality types and the genres of music they prefer . i found an article trying to tackle ... catwalk you're obviously more well-versed in this than i am , and i see that i've made some mistakes with this thread , thank you for pointing them out . i'll make sure to do better next time . ahh , my sides .. : laughing : that would be my answer . in your example i wouldn't care how miserable i became as long as i knew that the other person will be happier without me . i'd just need to know that , and nothing else would ... very nicely put . i agree completely . i find it sad and understandable at the same time , because i know how hard it is to be perfectly honest with yourself . yes , you definitely do deserve that . if you never ask , the answer is always no . well , i believe it takes courage to ask for help , because even if you don't fear rejection , it could be ... it doesn't ? cynical would be a bit harsh , but i get where you're coming from . i certainly think that people are motivated purely by self-interest but i'm not distrustful of human sincerity or ... i'm also highly susceptible this way . if the roles were swapped , i personally wouldn't really care about receiving help . to be honest , i often find it hard to ask for it . i always felt more ... so , in the end , you do get something out of it . at the least , you avoid feeling bad . this is awfully interesting . i honestly want to know why you're doing this . if all you get out of it is to cringe .. i mean .. what's driving you to do something cringey ? it doesn't seem you like to ... i've been there . it still occurs with me sometimes , because i'm really hell-bent on never letting anyone down . ( though i'm working on fixing this habit of mine .. ) i meant all the possible ... soo , if i understand correctly , that acknowledgement that comes from you helping people must be so satisfying to you that you're even willing to go through the cringe . or am i seriously off the mark ? ... my thoughts exactly . but i want to say that ultimately , i don't believe it to be a bad thing . one must learn to care for themselves before they can even attempt to care for others . i think that for ... yes , and in this case i think you help because you know that doing the act itself will feel good to you . would you still help if you didn't know this ? i have the utmost respect for the people you described . i would never question their vocation to help others . and to be honest , i don't think i'd care much if that company is corrupt , because nothing ... i certainly will , thank you ! i'm the same way . i don't measure what good will it do to me if i help someone , because it feels good to do so . but that's the thing i know . that it feels good . when i ask the question why do i help ... well , i'm really sorry to bore you : unsure : precisely . well , in case of helping out friends for example , i'm not expecting anything else in return . i just do that because it makes me feel good . like what you said in your last sentence . of ... i'm not trying to undermine people who put others before themselves ( i am / was one of them ) , but .. if i really think about it , i don't think anyone can make such a choice that they don't believe ... i literally don't leave home without my audio player , but i'm doing this too . though sometimes i get so immersed in the music , i barely walk for minutes : tongue : exactly . only you can decide what's your purpose . as for me , there's mainly two things . firstly , i like to gain experience and every single day i'm consciously putting in effort to better myself ... thanks for the recommendation , it looks it's right up my alley : joyous : while i'm here , i'd recommend something too : yahari ore no seishun rabukome wa machigatte iru . originally it's a light ... i agree , maybe this is why i'm attracted to ( heartbreaking ) dramas .
