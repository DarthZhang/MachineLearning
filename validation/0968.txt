' greetings , fellow intjs . long time , no posts . so , what lead to this was me asking if anyone who's going to college orientation at the same time wanted to meet up the night before for dinner or ... also , i'm sick of all the does this intj like me or is x type compatible with an intj and where do i find intj girls / guys . we don't know you . we can't tell you you're gonna have a magical ... i keep like , meeting people . and they're cool . and it's amazing , in that moment . we're friends for a few hours , and then we're both gone . i don't know if i want this to continue or if i want a ... if by profile pic you're referring to my forum avatar , that's from hyouka , but in terms of the profile picture ( picture viewed in user's profile page ) that'd be my face . heyo , can my named be changed to embarrassedghost ? i used captainofunicorns everywhere from ages 13-16 , and then my little sister decided to go by the master unicorn , which is simply too close for ... it's embarrassing , and seems like wasted time , i suppose . one of the first thing people ask when like meet me is so do you like ... draw ? apparently it's because i look like the stereotypical art nerd kid , whatever that is . they're correct . art is my thing , ... very picky , but i used to really like trying new things . i had an eating disorder so this still causes a lot of eating related anxiety , so safe foods include granola bars , fruit , and coffee ... 81 , thought i was getting better about this . ha . though , a lot of this isn't fear , it's just being good at avoiding things . 324785 this is my aussie shepherd mix davy jones <3 i also have a chow mix , a coon hound , a shetland pony , a horse , 5 chickens and two guineas . but i don't have any handy pictures of them . ... i do the same thing . and a lot of times , the emotions have to go away for me to process what the deal with them is . if your son is uninterested in romance , why are you pushing it ? edit : whoops , this thread is a bit old , ignore me . answers : 1 ) yes . 2 ) also yes . we are , in fact , human . and capable of forming crushes , crazy as it sounds . :) i think it makes people more at ease if you smile around them . people often comment on how i don't smile , my best friend's mom said it looks like she's being beaten every time she saw me , then ... surprises ? do not like . and receiving gifts seems just awkward , i don't know if i show enough gratitude so i freak out . but surprising others ? i enjoy that . i get this all the time , from my parents . still not really sure if they think i'm mean ... ? well , if you sedate him no one gets cake . walk the moon , to drown out the noises in my head . are you looking for advice in this area or are you asking if we think this intj cares about you ? as other have mentioned , we're probably an obsessive bunch . personally , i have ocd ( though it's gotten much more manageable than it used to be ) and have maybe become addicted to some behaviors in the ... it's too hard to pick . i do think the aristocats and treasure planet are underrated , however . awful in school , and my favorite movie is the princess diaries . why . glad i'm not the only one :D i'm not familiar with stacking , what is that exactly ? am i the only intj who seems to be very needy / clingy ( but not in a physical sense ) with close friends ? asking what the kid's name is might solve it . if it's a name that could be either , just use the kid's name in the place of the pronoun . online ? my friends ? yes , all the time . because i'm bored , miss them , or am simply curious . why's it creepy ? should you tell him ? yeah , if you want to . just be like hey man , i really like you . blunt is good . last time someone i wasn't interested in told me they liked me , it didn't ruin our ... hm , why do i like anime ? good question , not quite sure . maybe i just appreciate nice art . some favorites would be hyouka , howl's moving castle , and tiger & bunny . i loved fantasy and scifi as ... bookshelves , a chair , and carefully hiding monsters , among other things . i've been wondering . fellow intjs , do you have a best friend ? have you ever had a best friend ? what's your relationship with them like ? or are you just a loner ? usually , my closest friends have ... have you found anyone you're interested in ? if not , why is being single so bad ? i know someone who apparently had a best friend online . one or two years later , he comes to find out they're a female intj . how they could have gotten that close without knowing that kinda confuses ... take a class , join a club , it may sound like an obvious idea but seriously , it forces people to meet and interact . i was in a similar place , ( not looking for a romantic relationship , but just to ... my dad is an istj . i can tell that usually he just doesn't understand me , but he's convinced it's because he doesn't understand girls , but i highly doubt that's the reason . find out her love language ? long distance makes everything but words of affirmation hard , but maybe you can figure something out . my best friend is also an intj . we're kinda a thing . ( complicated explanation , long distance involved . ) anyway , i'd say an intj with an intj would be great . dad : istj mom : infp oldest brother : intp oldest sister : isxj me : intj filled with teenage angst , likely due to being misunderstood by parents . younger sister : infp my three other siblings ... ah , i tried something relatively similar when i was about twelve , ( a plot to become dominant in my social surroundings and make people like me ) but soon it wore me out , did you not get tired of it ? just curious . for example , i was ( and still am , i suppose ) incredibly shy . i met this girl when i was seven , we had the same name so our mothers thought we should obviously be friends . the girl ... do i like chess ? yes , it's a pleasant pastime . though i wouldn't be quick to say i view other people as my pieces , i do try to know their moves . as someone in a similar situation , i suggest asking her to see a movie with you / going for coffee / whatever for a little while , it may not make her really happy but if nothing else it can distract her ... love and romantic attraction are not the same thing , but to answer your question , yes , i have been in love . romantic attraction isn't something i experience strongly , however . no , because being so miserable that you want to die , is well , miserable . i usually find intps to be pretty neat people . from very few people , and not when i'm trying to do something . on my way to make a cup of coffee ? no hugs , please , i want my coffee . houtarou oreki , and he's either an intp or intj , also i think there was a thread discussing this sometime last week . i've been told by my friends it's amazing how much you just don't care . i've always been homeschooled / unschooled . the unschooling concept is mostly cover what you're required to , then study what interests you . i can't say i really enjoy school , but my situation suits me ... i will share one fear that i have overcome . from the time i was 8 to the time i was about 11 , nonperishable foods freaked me out so much that the idea kept me up at night . like what if you were ... i fear that i am a boring person , dolls , and being stuck in a coma but still having a conscious brain . greetings , i've browsed the forms on occasion since a couple years ago after finding interest in personality types / the mbti , but then i was like hey i guess i could make and account . i like ...
