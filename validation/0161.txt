( but not in any significant danger . ) i don't understand the point in the bachelor . my mom's watching it , and some chick is like . omg i've never been so much in love . he's my soulmate ! .. yeah . he really has a special connection ... i hate being such a weak person . my emotions are always expressed on my face , and my mom likes to say you're such a spoiled brat , look , you're about to cry . you need to get rid of that attitude , ... i'm making an ice cream cake . i hope it turns out okay ! ! if it wasn't such a tiny room , i don't know if i'd ever make it out alive . i found an enlarged version for you guys : the image doesn't particularly interest me , ... i have to write a short story for a contest by tomorrow ... the 90s for sure , i love all the genres of rock from that era , especially grunge ! i'm a little bit obsessed with nirvana if you haven't already noticed ( it is where my nickname comes from ) , and it's ... i had no idea you were such a poet , blue ! please excuse my boldness , but you're really cute . i like your hair , it looks incredibly fluffy and soft . i'm not sure that i quite understand , but thank you for the sincere compliment . i'm pretty strange in terms of personality as well , so perhaps those two in combination with each other would explain ... i like my new hair colour . some of religious topics on this subforum really irritate me . i respect your beliefs , but not all religious people are infp and not all infps are religious , and in many cases there's no personality ... my entp best friend told me what my birthday is . she's gonna try to get a cute guy to like me . i don't even know who he is . all i know is that he likes 90s music . ohgodtheanxiety . all i wanted for my birthday was for you to talk to me , and you couldn't even give me that much . i guess you figured a hbd was good enough . oh , and what was the point of asking when my birthday ... i'm really tired . not just physically , although partially that too from oversleeping , but of existing . i'm so lonely and bored and nothing seems to serve a purpose . all my friends are moving on and ... your post was almost completely off-topic and that's probably one reason why it was ignored . stop being a typist and painting all infps negatively just because they didn't drop everything to come ... happiness exists only in dreams . can't i have a slice of cake in life , too ? from a side profile , you have joseph gordon-levitt's face . x3 i had the courage to give my phone number to a super cute , popular and smart guy . i'm dying . xd but i'm not crazy , i'm just a little unwell i know right now you can't tell but stay awhile and maybe then you'll see a different side of me aww , thanks . that's a cute idea . i had a penis drawn on my back once when i was the first to fall asleep at a slumber party . xd '
